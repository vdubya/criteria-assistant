# UFC and UFGS Specification Writing Standards

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive set of standards and guidelines for authors of Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) documents and Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS). It consolidates formatting requirements, writing style conventions, and content organization rules drawn from official criteria (UFC 1-300-01 and UFC 1-300-02) and industry best practices (Construction Specifications Institute’s SectionFormat/PageFormat). The first section covers standards common to both UFC and UFGS publications – emphasizing clarity of language, consistency in terminology, use of units and references, and general writing principles. The second section details standards unique to UFC documents, including required document sections (from cover page to appendices), formatting of pages and paragraphs, and criteria-specific content requirements. The third section enumerates standards specific to UFGS sections, such as the three-part section format, numbering schema, use of SpecsIntact software features (tags for options, references, and submittals), and coordination with MasterFormat®. Finally, the fourth section summarizes CSI Manual of Practice best practices for specification writing, reinforcing concepts like the three-part format, the “Four C’s” of spec language (clear, concise, correct, complete), coordination between drawings and specifications, and avoiding ambiguity or unenforceable text. All standards are accompanied by citations to the source documents and relevant paragraphs for traceability. This document is formatted with numbered headings and itemized rules, suitable for formal internal use, and includes footnote references to the original UFC, UFGS, and CSI guidance documents to ensure accuracy and accountability in specification development. The goal is to provide specification writers with a definitive reference that ensures UFC and UFGS documents are written to a consistent, high-quality standard, compliant with DoD criteria and industry norms.

## 1. Standards Applicable to Both UFC and UFGS Documents

1. **Clear, Direct Language and Active Voice:** Write criteria and specifications in a clear, straightforward manner using simple, concise sentences and active voice. Use present tense and, where appropriate, the imperative mood to address the reader (e.g. “install equipment” rather than “the Contractor shall install equipment”). This direct style improves clarity and makes requirements immediately understandable. Avoid ambiguous qualifiers like “relatively simple” or “too short” – quantify requirements whenever possible instead of using indefinites. Tailor language to the expected user’s expertise level (experienced professionals) so that the text is neither overly simplistic nor needlessly verbose. Following the “Four C’s” of specification writing – **clear, concise, correct,** and **complete** – is essential to avoid misinterpretation.

2. **Imperative Mood and Consistent Terminology:** Use the **imperative mood** for instructions and requirements in technical criteria and guide specs, as this is standard practice for contract documents. Avoid using “shall” to state mandatory requirements; instead use **“must”** in UFC criteria documents where necessary to denote obligation, or simply write directives in imperative form in UFGS sections (the subject “Contractor shall” is implied). The word “shall” can imply futurity or be interpreted inconsistently, whereas “must” conveys an unequivocal requirement. Use **“will”** to indicate future actions by the Government (or to express factual statements), **“may”** and **“can”** for permissive or optional actions, and **“should”** for advisory or recommended practices. Do not address the contractor as “he” or “she” – use gender-neutral language (e.g. use “they” as a singular generic pronoun or rewrite the sentence to avoid personal pronouns). Ensure terminology is used consistently throughout the document and matches terms used in drawings and other project documents (for example, if a piece of equipment is called *Chiller* on drawings, use the same term in specs).

3. **Abbreviations and Acronyms:** Define acronyms and abbreviations on first use and use them consistently. Spell out terms in full the first time they appear in the text, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses, then use the abbreviation thereafter. For example: “Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS)” – subsequent mentions can just use “UFGS.” Use standard abbreviations as defined by the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual and the DoD Writing Style Guide. Avoid Latin abbreviations like “e.g.” or “i.e.” in the running text – instead write out “for example” or “that is” for clarity (Latin abbreviations may be used within tables/figures if needed). DoD-specific acronyms should conform to the **Joint Publication 1-02** or other official DoD sources. An acronym that is not commonly known or is used fewer than three times in a document should not be used at all – instead, spell out the term each time or avoid it. Acronyms that appear in UFC or UFGS titles or text should be collected in a glossary if they are numerous (see Section 2 and 3 for glossary requirements). Consistency and standardization in abbreviations help prevent confusion.

4. **Numbers and Units of Measure:** Provide measurement values in **dual units** to accommodate both English (Imperial) and metric systems, unless directed otherwise by the specific program or project. In UFC criteria documents, the convention is often to present measurements in inch-pound units followed by metric units in parentheses. In UFGS master specifications, present **Metric units first** with the corresponding English units in brackets or tagged (e.g. “<MET>50 mm</MET><ENG>2 inches</ENG>”). Do *not* use dual-unit values in parentheses for UFGS; instead, use the SpecsIntact unit tags to allow automatic unit selection. Perform unit conversions according to ASTM SI-10 standards for consistency. All units should be used consistently (avoid mixing SI and Imperial within the same context) and **do not mix unit formats** (for example, do not write one dimension in metric and another in Imperial for the same kind of measurement). If a particular project will use only one system, the spec should be edited to retain only that system’s values (SpecsIntact can automate this selection). By providing both sets of units in master documents, the criteria remain usable internationally and meet DoD metric policy, while allowing flexibility for project-specific needs.

5. **Capitalization, Punctuation, and Grammar:** Follow the **U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual** for all rules on capitalization, abbreviations, hyphenation, spelling, and punctuation. This ensures that UFCs and UFGS use standard government publishing conventions (for example, capitalizing defined terms or proper nouns appropriately, using serial commas, etc.). Use **title case** (capitalize principal words) for section or paragraph titles unless otherwise specified, and use **ALL-CAPS** only where required (such as cover page titles or certain document designation lines). Maintain a professional and formal tone throughout. Avoid colloquial or subjective language. Use **plain language** as mandated by Federal Plain Language Guidelines – this means prefer simple words over complex ones, break up long sentences, and organize content logically. Every sentence should be grammatically complete and free of spelling errors (a thorough spell-check and review is required as a final step). Adhering to these conventions makes the documents easier to read and less prone to misinterpretation.

6. **External Reference Standards:** **Reference external standards rather than restating their content.** Wherever practical, cite well-known industry standards (e.g. ASTM, ANSI, ASHRAE, IEEE) to define requirements, instead of writing proprietary or duplicative criteria in the UFC/UFGS text. This leverages accepted industry practices and keeps documents concise. Identify referenced publications in the text by their designation/number (and year, if applicable) – for example, “conform to ASTM C150” – and list the full citation in the reference list or section (see specific requirements for reference lists in Sections 2 and 3). Document titles or full descriptions of standards are generally **not** included in the body text (to maintain readability); instead, the full title and publication information will appear in the References appendix or article. If an external publication is web-based, include the name of the website and the URL in the reference listing. Always use the **most current edition** of the referenced standard unless a specific older version is required for the project – per UFGS guidance, cite the latest issue year and any revision letters in the reference list as listed in the Unified Master Reference List (UMRL). Do **not** copy extensive passages from external standards into the criteria; if it is absolutely necessary to quote or excerpt a portion for clarity, limit it to less than a page and present it as an indented block quote with appropriate attribution. This prevents inadvertent contradictions and copyright issues. In summary, **refer, don’t repeat** – reference external codes and standards by citation to incorporate their requirements by reference.

7. **Avoiding Duplication and Conflicts:** Do not duplicate information that belongs in other documents or sections. For UFC criteria: avoid repeating material that is contained in higher-level UFCs (for example, UFC 1-200-01 “General Building Requirements”) or in other core criteria documents. For UFGS sections: avoid overlapping content between sections – each guide specification section should address a distinct scope of work as defined by MasterFormat, and should rely on Division 01 general requirements for common provisions (e.g. do not include general contract terms or admin processes that are covered in Division 01). Adhere to the CSI principle of “say it once and in the right place.” Thus, **coordination** is critical: ensure that requirements are stated either in the drawings, in Division 01, or in a specification section – but not duplicated in multiple places. If cross-references are needed, use them judiciously (see next item). This practice minimizes contradictions and ensures that if changes occur, they need to be made in only one location. Always cross-check related documents (drawings, other specs, criteria) to eliminate discrepancies. UFC and UFGS standards explicitly advise not to reproduce content from UFC 1-200-01 or base building code criteria inside individual documents, and similarly, UFGS sections should not repeat standard specs that are referenced. By maintaining strict separation of content, the specifications and criteria will be **consistent and legally enforceable** as a part of the contract or guidance package.

8. **Cross-References Within Text:** Use precise cross-references and avoid vague terms such as “above,” “below,” or “preceding” when referring to other parts of the text. If referring to another section of a UFC document, cite the chapter or paragraph number (e.g. “see Chapter 3, paragraph 3-2.5”). In UFGS sections, avoid referencing other specification sections or paragraphs unless absolutely necessary. If a cross-reference to another spec section is needed, format it as **“Section \[number] – \[Section Title]”** – for example: *“See Section 09 90 00 – PAINTS AND COATINGS for painting requirements.”*. Always include both the section number and the full section title in such references so the context is clear. When referencing a specific paragraph within the *same* UFGS section, refer to it by its title rather than by its number (e.g. “refer to paragraph **EQUIPMENT** in this section”). This is because paragraph numbers in UFGS will automatically renumber as the spec is edited, whereas titles remain constant. In UFC documents, internal cross-references may use paragraph numbers since those are fixed once published (e.g. “see paragraph 2-3.5”) – ensure the referenced paragraph exists and the numbering is up-to-date. In all cases, **do not rely on positional phrases** (like “the following section” or “preceding table”) which can become incorrect after edits. By using explicit section/paragraph identifiers or titles, cross-references remain accurate and user-friendly.

9. **Document Structure and Organization:** Ensure the document (UFC or UFGS) is structured logically and in accordance with its required format. Both UFCs and UFGS follow a hierarchical outline that should be strictly observed for consistency. Major divisions (chapters in UFCs, parts in UFGS) break content into manageable segments. Subordinate headings and paragraphs should be used liberally to organize information by topic, but **depth should be controlled** – do not create an unnecessarily deep outline. As a general rule, avoid going beyond four levels of subparagraphs in UFC documents and beyond six levels in UFGS sections (the SpecsIntact system permits up to six subparagraph levels). If a higher-level heading is divided, there should be at least two sublevel entries (e.g. never have a single subparagraph labeled “a.” without a “b.”). Maintain the required order of sections: for UFCs this means front matter (cover, foreword, etc.), followed by Chapter 1 (general info), subsequent technical chapters, and appendices in the specified sequence; for UFGS, always Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 in order. Organized documents enhance readability and enforce a consistent approach to criteria and specification writing across all services.

10. **Quality Control and Review:** Both UFC and UFGS documents must be thoroughly reviewed for compliance with these standards before publication or use. Use available tools: for UFGS, the SpecsIntact software provides automated reports (e.g. to check that all references listed are cited in the text and vice versa, to identify bracketed options not addressed, etc.) – utilize these to catch omissions. Perform manual checks for formatting consistency (headers, footers, numbering) and run spell-check. Ensure all cited references are included in the reference list and all acronyms are in the glossary if required. Confirm that all figures, tables, or forms are titled and numbered correctly and referred to in the text. A final editorial review should verify that the document is free of spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, and grammatical issues. By following a rigorous QC process, specification writers can ensure the published UFC or UFGS meets the highest standards of professionalism and technical accuracy, thereby reducing the risk of contract disputes or misinterpretation in the field.

## 2. Standards Specific to UFC Documents (Unified Facilities Criteria)

1. **Cover Page Requirements:** Every UFC document must have a standardized **cover page** that clearly identifies it as a UFC and provides key information. The cover must include: the **criteria type** (Unified Facilities Criteria or Facilities Criteria) in bold, centered uppercase text; the **document title** in bold uppercase (typically a descriptive title of the subject matter); and the official **DoD publication number** (e.g. UFC 1-300-01) with the publication date. It also includes the appropriate **distribution statement** (usually *Distribution A* for public release) prominently at the bottom of the page. For example, most unclassified UFCs will show “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.”. If the UFC is designated as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or otherwise restricted, use Distribution Statement C with the required justification and date. No page number is shown on the cover. The cover page’s layout (margins, fonts) should follow the UFC Template provided by the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG).

2. **Title Page and Record of Changes:** Following the cover, include a **title page** containing publication metadata and change history. The title page in a UFC should display a standard notice (usually a disclaimer and copyright statement) and list the **Participating Government Agencies** (with the lead preparing activity identified). Below that, provide a **Record of Changes** table or list, enumerating any approved Changes (by number and date) to the UFC. Each change entry notes the change number, date, and a brief description of what was changed or the reason, if applicable. For a newly issued UFC with no changes, the record may simply state “Initial Issue” or be left blank aside from the original publication. Ensure the title page is not numbered (like the cover, it’s front matter). Subsequent pages of front matter (e.g. the Foreword, if any) use lowercase roman numeral page numbers.

3. **Foreword and Summary Sheet:** UFC documents typically include a **Foreword** that outlines the authority under which the UFC is issued and distribution details. The Foreword should identify the issuing service or agency, state that the document is effective upon issuance, and indicate supersession of previous documents if applicable (often this is where it says “This UFC supersedes …” with older document numbers). It also often provides contact information for suggestions or changes (Criteria Change Request procedures). Next, include a **Summary Sheet** (if required by UFC format) which provides a high-level summary of major changes or the purpose of the document. In UFC 1-300-01 (Criteria Format Standard), for example, the Summary of Changes or **Description of Changes** may be listed before the Table of Contents, highlighting key updates in that edition. The Summary Sheet is a quick reference for users to see what has been updated in the UFC. Both the Foreword and any summary pages are part of the front matter and use roman numeral page numbering (continuing from the title page).

4. **Table of Contents:** Provide a **Table of Contents (TOC)** for the UFC after the front matter. The TOC should list all chapters, main paragraphs (level 1 headings), and appendices with their corresponding page numbers. Use the predefined styles in the UFC Template to format the TOC – typically, chapter titles and first-level paragraph titles are aligned with dot leaders to their page numbers. The TOC page(s) themselves are numbered with lowercase romanettes (continuing the front matter sequence). Ensure the TOC is comprehensive and up-to-date: every numbered heading in the document (chapter, paragraph, appendix) that is required by UFC format should appear. However, **do not list** lower-level subparagraphs in the TOC if the UFC format standard doesn’t require it (usually only up to level 2 headings appear, depending on length). For example, UFC 1-300-01’s TOC includes Chapter 3 major paragraph titles like “Background Paragraph,” “Purpose and Scope Paragraph,” etc., but not every subparagraph below them. Follow the UFC format guidance for how many heading levels to include. The TOC is an essential roadmap for users and must be accurate – update page numbers after finalizing the document content.

5. **Page Layout, Margins, and Font (UFC):** UFC criteria documents use a standard page layout for consistency across all publications. The required paper size is **8.5 × 11 inch** (Letter size) with standard margins: **1 inch** at the top, left, and right, and **0.75 inch** at the bottom. All body text is left-aligned (ragged right) at the margin; do not justify the text fully. A single, legible font is mandated: **12-point Arial** is the default font for text in UFCs (Arial or a similar sans-serif font ensures readability; if another font is used by a specific template, it will be indicated, but generally 12 pt Arial is standard). Color fonts or colored highlights should be avoided; if color is used (for example, in figures), ensure that the content is still distinguishable when printed in black and white. **Headers and Footers:** Position the header (marginal information) and footer within the top and bottom margins at **0.5 inch from the edge** of the page. The UFC page header (top margin) typically contains the document number, date, and change number on the right side (right-justified as marginal text) and sometimes the classification or series on the left. Page numbers are placed in the footer, centered at the bottom of each page. Avoid using landscape (rotated) pages or foldouts – large tables or figures should be split or scaled if possible, as foldout sheets are discouraged in UFCs.

6. **Headers and Footers Content:** Each page of a UFC (except the cover, title, and foreword) should have a header identifying the document and a footer with the page number. In the **header**, include the UFC designation and title (short form) and publication date. The UFC number and title (or an abbreviated title) appear right-justified on the first line of the header, and the publication date (and change number, if applicable) on the line below it. For example, a header might read: “UFC 3-530-01 – INTERIOR LIGHTING SYSTEMS” on one line and the date “01 April 2015 (Change 3, 01 June 2016)” on the next line. (Volume number information is included in the header if the UFC is one volume of a multi-part series, e.g. “Volume 1 of 2” as needed.) The **footer** of each page from the TOC onward contains the page number centered at the bottom. Do not include chapter numbers or appendix letters in the page numbering scheme; page numbers run consecutively through the main body (typically starting at “1” on the first page of Chapter 1). Front matter (TOC, etc.) is numbered separately with roman numerals, and appendices continue the main body page numbering. No other text should appear in the footer area except the page number (e.g. no document title down there, to avoid redundancy). Ensure headers/footers are consistent and set by the UFC template; do not manually alter their alignment or content except to insert the correct data for that UFC.

7. **Paragraph Numbering in UFC Chapters:** All paragraphs in a UFC main body (Chapters and Appendices) are **numbered hierarchically** to facilitate precise reference. Use the automatic formatting from the UFC template for numbering to ensure proper boldface and indentation. In a UFC divided into chapters, the numbering format is: *Chapter X-* for first-level paragraphs, followed by a sequential number. For example, in Chapter 2, the first paragraph is numbered “**2-1**”. Subparagraphs are numbered by adding another level of decimal numbering: **2-1.1**, 2-1.1.1, etc., up to four levels (2-1.1.1.1) as needed. If the UFC is not divided into multiple chapters (rare for UFCs, but if it were a short document), paragraphs might be numbered without the chapter prefix; however, UFC 1-300-01 indicates that if chapters are used, include the chapter number and a dash in front of each paragraph number. **Appendix paragraphs** are numbered similarly: prefix the appendix letter followed by a dash, then the paragraph number (e.g. A-1, A-1.1). Importantly, do not “restart” numbering in a new chapter beyond including the new chapter number – for instance, Chapter 3 paragraphs will begin 3-1, 3-2, etc., independent of Chapter 2’s sequence. Maintain **sequential order** and ensure every level has at least two entries if subdivided (i.e., if there is a paragraph 2-4.1, there should be a 2-4.2). The UFC format limits subparagraph depth to four levels for clarity. Use of the UFC MS Word template is recommended so that these numbering rules are enforced automatically – manual changes to numbering format are not allowed. Proper numbering is crucial for internal cross-referencing and overall document organization.

8. **Paragraph Titles and Text (UFC):** In UFC documents, **every numbered paragraph and subparagraph must have an explicit title** (a brief heading) that summarizes its content. The titling conventions are: Level 1 paragraph titles (those with numbers like 1-1, 2-3, etc.) are formatted in **bold UPPERCASE**. Subparagraph titles at lower levels (2-1.1, 2-1.1.1, etc.) are formatted in **bold Title Case** (capitalizing first letters of major words). The title is separated from its paragraph number by a single space and ends with a period. For example: “**3-3.5 BEST PRACTICES APPENDIX.**” would be a level 1 title, whereas “**3-3.5.1 Scope of Best Practices.**” (if it existed) would be in title case. Indent the run-over lines of titles 1 inch from the left margin (the UFC template usually handles this). After the title, the body text of the paragraph begins on a new line, aligned at the left margin (no extra indent on the first line of text). **Paragraph text** itself should generally not be broken into unnumbered chunks beneath a heading. The UFC format guide directs: use no more than two paragraphs of body text under any given heading without further subdivision. In other words, if you find a need for more than two continuous paragraphs under one title, consider adding subparagraph headings to organize them. Keep spacing between paragraphs consistent – typically one blank line (equivalent to 12 pt spacing) between paragraphs is standard, and this may be reduced to 6 pt if needed to keep content on a page. Following these rules yields a clean, navigable document: readers can skim by titles, and paragraphs are easy to reference and discuss by their numbers and headings.

9. **Lists and Bullet Style:** When including lists in UFC text, choose an appropriate list style based on context. If the order or sequence of items matters (steps in a procedure, ranked preferences), use a **numbered list** or lettered list. If the list is simply a set of examples or conditions with no inherent order, use **bulleted** (symbol) lists or lettered subparagraphs. The UFC guidance says to **use bullets for unordered lists** of items or short points, and use alphabetical or numeric labels when a specific order or reference is needed. Bullet symbols should be simple (solid circle or dash as provided by the template). Lists should not be overused as a substitute for proper paragraph structure; if a bulleted list grows too lengthy or extends beyond one page, consider converting some items into separate paragraphs or subparagraphs with titles. Ensure list indentations are consistent (the UFC template usually provides a hanging indent style for bullets and letters). Leave a small space (6 pt) between bullet items and a 12 pt space before continuing with normal text after a list. This spacing may be adjusted (down to 6 pt after a list) to avoid awkward page breaks. Also, **maintain parallel construction** in list items: each item should be a similar grammatical form (e.g. all noun phrases or all commands) for readability. By following these practices, lists will effectively highlight information without disrupting the overall flow of the document.

10. **Tables and Figures in UFCs:** Present tabular data in formal **tables** rather than in lengthy text lists for clarity. All tables must be numbered and titled, and referred to in the text by their number. Number tables sequentially **within each chapter** (if chapters are used) or throughout the document if not. The numbering format is Chapter-based in UFCs: e.g., Table 2-1, Table 2-2 for tables in Chapter 2. If the UFC has appendices, tables in Appendix A would be Table A-1, A-2, etc. Place each table as close as possible to the first reference to it in the text, generally **after** the paragraph where it is mentioned. Center tables on the page and use a consistent format: column headers in **bold**, consider a slight shading for header row for readability, and use grid lines sparingly (often just top and bottom of table and under header row). If a table is too large to fit on one page, it may continue on the next page – repeat the header row on the continuation and indicate “(Continued)” in the title if necessary. The minimum font size for table contents is 8 pt to maintain legibility if space is tight. Tables may be oriented landscape if absolutely required for fit, but avoid this if possible. Each table should have a descriptive title above it (e.g. “Table 2-1 – Example Lighting Control Strategies”) and units or notes as needed below it. Similarly, **figures** (diagrams, charts) in UFCs should be numbered sequentially by chapter (Figure 3-1, 3-2, etc.) and have a caption beneath them. Refer to figures in text as “Figure X-X.” Figures can be rotated to landscape format if needed. All figures and tables must be cited in the text and should aid in illustrating the criteria – avoid including purely decorative figures. Additionally, **equations** that are presented separate from text should be centered and may be numbered (if there are multiple equations to reference). Ensure equation font is at least 8 pt and leave adequate spacing above and below (around 24 pt above, 12 pt below). By following these standards, UFC tables, figures, and equations will be easily readable and appropriately integrated into the document.

11. **Safety Warnings and Cautions:** In certain UFCs, particularly those dealing with operations, maintenance, or safety-critical procedures, it may be necessary to highlight hazards using **WARNING**, **CAUTION**, or **NOTE** headings in the text. Use these sparingly and only when essential to draw attention to potential injury, death, or equipment damage situations. For example, a UFC for operation of equipment might include: **WARNING:** *“Failure to follow lockout procedures could result in electrocution.”* When using such headings, format them in accordance with MIL-STD-38784A guidance (the military standard for technical manuals). Typically, “WARNING” and “CAUTION” statements are in all-caps bold and may precede the relevant instruction. Do not overuse them; integrate them only to prevent serious hazards. Less critical advisories can be given as “Note:” within the text. Ensure any warning/caution is placed immediately before the step or information to which it applies so users cannot miss it. The UFC format standard itself does not rigidly prescribe the graphic format for warnings, but it defers to MIL-STD-38784A for those who need detailed guidance. Additionally, do not include any safety warning that is not substantiated by the content (i.e. it should correspond to a real hazard addressed in the criteria). By adhering to these practices, necessary safety information will stand out and be taken seriously by the reader.

12. **UFC Chapter 1 Content – Required Paragraphs:** Every UFC’s first chapter should establish the document’s purpose, applicability, and other introductory information according to a standard set of paragraph headings. Chapter 1 of a UFC usually includes the following mandatory (or conditionally mandatory) paragraphs:

    * **“Background”** – *optional*, include if context on why the criteria was created or revised is important. For instance, note if it consolidates previous guidance or responds to a specific issue.
    * **“Purpose and Scope”** – states the objective of the UFC and the breadth of topics or facilities it covers. Clearly define what the document is intended to accomplish and any limitations of scope.
    * **“Applicability”** – identifies who must comply with the UFC (e.g. all DoD components, only certain services, contractors, etc.). It might note if it’s mandatory for new designs, existing facilities, etc., and any exceptions.
    * **“References”** – a paragraph in Chapter 1 may simply point to the References Appendix, or in some UFCs, Chapter 1 includes a short list of key policy references. According to UFC 1-300-01, a reference list (appendix) is *mandatory* if the UFC cites other documents. Common practice is to have a references appendix rather than listing them all in Chapter 1, so the “References” paragraph often says “A list of references is located in Appendix C.”
    * **“Cancellation” or “Supersession”** – identify any older criteria documents that this UFC replaces or cancels (often titled “**Reissues and Cancels**” or “**Supersedes**”). Include document numbers and titles of superseded UFCs or other documents.
    * **“Authority” / “Administration”** – sometimes titled “Overarching Criteria” or “Functional Requirements,” this paragraph can mention higher authority requirements (like mandated use of building codes via UFC 1-200-01, or DoD policy that underpins the criteria). It might reference OSD or Congressional mandates if relevant.
    * **“Other Codes and Standards”** – if the UFC modifies or adds to model building codes or industry standards, include a **“Non-Government Standards Modification”** paragraph (usually in Chapter 1 or 3) to explicitly state those modifications. Per UFC 1-300-01, criteria that amend building codes must list those changes (often referencing the specific sections of e.g. IBC or NFPA being modified).
    * **“General Building Requirements”** – many UFCs include a statement that UFC 1-200-01 (which adopts building codes and other general requirements) applies and is not duplicated in this document. This ensures users remember to consult the base building requirements.
    * **“Glossary”** – If the UFC will use numerous acronyms or unique terms, Chapter 1 may include a placeholder paragraph noting that a Glossary is provided (the actual Glossary will be an appendix). UFC guidance now makes a glossary *mandatory* if any uncommon acronyms are used. The paragraph can say “Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations is located in Appendix B.”
    * **“Points of Contact”** – some UFCs list proponent or subject matter POCs (this might be in foreword or appendix instead).
      Each UFC’s Chapter 1 should use the exact headings and order as specified in UFC 1-300-01 for consistency. Do not omit required sections; if information is not applicable, the paragraph should be included with a statement like “Not Applicable” (unless the UFC format standard allows it to be omitted). By providing this standard introductory content, users of the UFC immediately understand its purpose, scope, authority, and how to apply it.

13. **Technical Chapters Content (UFC Chapters 2+):** After the introductory chapter, UFCs proceed with one or more **technical chapters** that contain the substantive criteria. The organization of these chapters should be tailored to the subject matter but also follow some general rules. Chapter 2 is typically the start of technical criteria. Additional chapters (3, 4, etc.) may be used to break the content into logical groupings (for example, a UFC might have Chapter 2 – Requirements, Chapter 3 – Application/Design Guidance, etc., or separate chapters for different systems). The UFC format guide suggests structuring the technical chapters to **focus on requirements and avoid extraneous guidance** in the main body. Include all unique DoD requirements and any necessary modifications to commercial standards in these chapters. Omit generic explanatory material – instead, detailed discussion, background theory, or best practice guidance belongs in a **Best Practices** appendix (see item 15 below) so that the main chapters remain focused on enforceable criteria. Within technical chapters, content can be organized by discipline or system as appropriate. For multidisciplinary criteria documents, UFC 1-300-01 recommends ordering content under common discipline subheadings (if applicable), such as **Architecture, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, etc.**, to ensure all fields are covered systematically. An example given is that a design UFC could have sections for *Sustainability Requirements*, *Physical Security Requirements*, then discipline-specific requirements like *Architectural*, *Civil*, *Mechanical*, etc., each as level 2 paragraphs under the chapter. Use performance-based requirements whenever possible in these chapters – state the required outcomes or criteria, rather than dictating prescriptive means, to allow flexibility and innovation. Also, include **exceptions** properly: if certain criteria have exceptions, list them clearly (following a methodology like the International Building Code’s style – e.g., state the rule, then enumerate exceptions). UFC 1-300-01 explicitly says to follow IBC practice for presenting exceptions. For example: “*Stairs shall have X; **Exception:** Stairs in facilities Y may instead have Z.*”. By structuring technical chapters with clear, requirement-focused paragraphs and logically grouping related topics, a UFC will be both comprehensive and user-friendly for designers and engineers who implement it.

14. **Appendices in UFCs:** UFC documents may include appendices for supporting information. UFC 1-300-01 defines specific appendices if needed, typically in this sequence after the main chapters: \*\*“Best Practices” Appendix, “Glossary” Appendix, “References” Appendix, and optionally an **“Index”**. Adhere to the following:

    * **“Best Practices” Appendix (Optional):** If the UFC warrants additional explanatory guidance, design tips, examples, or background information that is **not mandatory**, include it in a “Best Practices” appendix (often Appendix A). Do not put any requirements or mandatory language in this section – it must strictly be non-binding commentary. The UFC format mandates that if a Best Practices appendix is provided, it should begin with a standard disclaimer: *“The Best Practices Appendix is considered to be guidance and not requirements. Its main purpose is to communicate proven facility solutions, systems, and lessons learned, but may not be the only solution to meet the requirement.”*. This statement should appear at the very start of the appendix in italics or a distinguishable format. The content in Best Practices should generally mirror the organization of the technical chapters for ease of reference (e.g. if Chapter 2 covered interior systems and Chapter 3 exterior systems, you might have Appendix A – Best Practices for Interior, Appendix B – Best Practices for Exterior). Keep commentary concise and relevant – it can include explanations of why certain criteria are required, example calculations, or recommended approaches beyond the minimum requirements. Avoid simply restating industry standards or extensive textbook material. Essentially, this section captures lessons learned and advice for designers to achieve the criteria.
    * **Glossary Appendix:** If the UFC uses acronyms, abbreviations, or specialized terms, include a Glossary as the **penultimate appendix** (second to last). The UFC standard now *requires* a glossary if any acronyms beyond very common ones (DoD, USAF, etc.) are used. Organize the Glossary into two parts if needed: one for **Acronyms and Abbreviations** and one for **Definitions of Terms**. Acronyms should be listed as they appear in the text (alphabetically), with their meaning spelled out. Definitions should be provided for any terms that might be unclear or have specific meanings in the context. If any definition is sourced from another document (e.g. a regulatory definition), cite the source in the glossary entry. Use the same font and alignment as the body text (the UFC template provides a style for glossary terms – often the terms are bold or italic and the definitions run on after a dash or colon). The Glossary greatly aids the reader in understanding the document without ambiguity.
    * **References Appendix:** The final appendix in a UFC is the **References** list. List here all documents cited in the UFC (and only those cited) in alphabetical order or categorized as described. UFC 1-300-01 instructs that if the reference list is long, it can be broken into categories such as **Government Standards, Non-Government Standards, Books and Periodicals, Web Sites**, etc.. For example, list all MIL-STD’s, UFCs, etc., under a “Government Standards” subheading, and all ASTM, ANSI, etc., under “Non-Government Standards”. Each reference entry should include sufficient info for the user to find it: typically the reference designation/number, title (in italics), and publishing organization. For standards, include the identifying number and title (and version year if not apparent in the number). For books or articles, include title, author, publisher, date. For websites, list the name of the site in uppercase and the URL. Ensure formatting is consistent (e.g., don’t mix italics and quotes arbitrarily – UFC typically uses italics for titles of standalone documents). Additionally, UFC 1-300-01 includes a **Publisher Information** paragraph (3-7.1) which can precede the reference list if needed, to give addresses or websites of publishers. In many cases this may not be necessary if references are easily obtainable online (the Whole Building Design Guide or ASSIST for military docs, etc.), but it can be included for completeness. The key is that any reference cited in the text must appear here, and users should have enough information to obtain the reference. Do not include documents that are not actually cited in the UFC. The reference appendix uses regular Arabic page numbering continued from the chapters (it does not restart numbering) and appears last.
    * **Index Appendix (optional):** A comprehensive index is generally **not required for UFCs** and in fact UFC 1-300-01 states that an index is *not to be included*. Because electronic PDF format allows keyword searching, and because maintaining an index is labor-intensive and quickly outdated by changes, the practice is to omit an index unless specifically directed. Therefore, in most cases, do **not** include an Index appendix. If a UFC is extremely lengthy and a decision is made to have an index, coordinate with the preparing activity and follow any special guidance for format (but again, this is discouraged by policy).
      Remember to letter appendices sequentially (A, B, C, etc.) and to include their titles in the TOC. The appendices should each start on a new page. Through proper use of appendices, a UFC can provide valuable supplemental material without cluttering the main body, and meet all requirements for glossary and references so that the document is complete and self-contained.

15. **Change Indication and Revisions (UFC):** When updating or revising a UFC, follow the standard method for indicating changes. UFCs often mark changes with change bars in the margins or other notation. On the title page or record of changes, identify the change number and date. Within the text, significant alterations from the previous version may be noted with a vertical line in the margin adjacent to the changed text (this is typically done via the UFC publishing process – authors can insert change bars or use track-changes for coordination). If a UFC is reissued as a complete update (as opposed to a minor change), it may not show every change bar, but the Summary of Changes or Description of Changes at the beginning should outline what’s new. When preparing a Change (as opposed to a new edition), do **not** renumber paragraphs unless absolutely necessary; keep existing numbering so that references remain valid, and only add suffixes or new numbers for new material. Remove any prior change markings once incorporated. Ensure that the footer reflects the current Change number (e.g. “Change 1, 2025”) throughout. Additionally, per UFC format, if a UFC document is one volume of a set or has been split into volumes, indicate volume numbers on the cover or headers as needed. By managing changes in this controlled manner, UFC revisions remain traceable and users can quickly identify updates without confusion.

By following the above UFC-specific standards, writers will produce criteria documents that are uniform in appearance and organization across the DoD, easy to navigate, and enforceable in practice. Each requirement from UFC 1-300-01 is addressed to ensure UFCs convey technical criteria effectively while meeting all administrative formatting rules.

## 3. Standards Specific to UFGS Documents (Unified Facilities Guide Specifications)

1. **CSI Three-Part Section Format:** All UFGS sections **must be organized into the three standard parts** – **Part 1 – GENERAL, Part 2 – PRODUCTS, Part 3 – EXECUTION** – consistent with CSI’s SectionFormat™. This format is a core requirement to promote uniformity across all guide specs. Do not add additional parts or omit any of the three. Each part covers a specific aspect:

   * **Part 1 – GENERAL:** Describes administrative and procedural requirements specific to the section. This typically includes: a brief **summary or scope** of the section, references to related sections, applicable **referenced standards**, **submittal requirements** (the “Submittals” article), quality assurance and quality control provisions, project/site conditions, delivery/storage requirements, and any definitions or units unique to that section. UFGS Part 1 should not duplicate Division 01 general requirements except to modify or augment them for the specific product.
   * **Part 2 – PRODUCTS:** Lists and describes the materials, products, equipment, fabrication, mix designs, or assemblies that are required for the section. It includes properties of materials, standards they must meet (often by referencing standards), allowable manufacturers (if applicable), and how components are to be fabricated or assembled before arriving to the site. If multiple products are involved, it can be organized with articles for each major item (e.g. “2.1 Cement”, “2.2 Aggregates” for a concrete spec). Accessory items that support the main products are also specified here (in an “ACCESSORIES” paragraph). No execution instructions or installation procedures should appear in Part 2 – limit it strictly to describing the **what** (the required products and their characteristics).
   * **Part 3 – EXECUTION:** Describes how the products are to be installed or applied at the project site. Common articles include **Examination** of existing conditions before work (ensuring substrates or previous work are acceptable), **Preparation** (actions like surface preparation, protection of surrounding areas), **Installation/Erection/Application** methods (detailed requirements for putting products in place), **Field Quality Control** (tests, inspections on installed work), **Adjusting and Cleaning** (post-installation finishing tasks), and **Closeout** actions like demonstrations or training if needed. The Execution part should cover all performance requirements and workmanship criteria, but it should *not* introduce new materials or product specs (those belong in Part 2).
     Using this structured approach for every UFGS section ensures that anyone familiar with CSI format can find information quickly. The **TOC** of a UFGS section (if one were generated) would simply list Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 with their titles; however, typically individual spec sections do not have an internal TOC due to their relatively short length, and per UFC 1-300-02, a TOC is not included within the section document itself. Instead, the project manual as a whole will have a TOC listing the section by number and title. Thus, ensure all UFGS content is placed in the appropriate part and article. Do not, for example, put installation instructions in Part 2 or mix procedural text into Part 1. Adhering to CSI’s SectionFormat is not only required by UFGS standards, but it also facilitates coordination since designers and contractors know exactly where in the section to look for specific information.

2. **MasterFormat Section Numbering and Titles:** Assign each UFGS a unique section number and title in accordance with **CSI MasterFormat** (latest edition). UFGS section numbers use MasterFormat’s six-digit format (and sometimes a two-digit extension for UFGS-specific designators). Ensure the **section title** exactly matches the MasterFormat title for that number, where one exists. For example, if MasterFormat lists “03 30 00 – Cast-in-Place Concrete,” the UFGS for that work must use that number and title. UFGS includes an additional fifth-level code (two digits after a decimal point) to indicate the preparing agency or other special designation. Specifically, by Tri-Service agreement, the **fifth-level designators** are: **“10” for Army**, **“20” for Navy**, **“30” for Air Force**, and **“40” for NASA**. These appear as the last two digits of the UFGS number (e.g., *01 45 00.00 10* might be an Army-specific version of a Quality Control spec). Use these only when a UFGS on the same topic has variations by agency that could not be reconciled into one unified text. The number before the decimal (the first 5 digits) still correspond to the MasterFormat number for the subject. The presence of a fifth-level code facilitates management in the UFGS system and on the WBDG site by clearly identifying branch-specific sections. **Never change MasterFormat numbers or titles without approval** – the UFGS Working Group coordinates numbering so that UFGS align with industry standard numbering. If a new section is created, select an appropriate MasterFormat number and title; do not invent a number. Likewise, do not retitle a section to something non-standard. The section number and title should appear in the document header and as the section heading at the top of the first page of the spec text (formatted per SpecsIntact template). If the UFGS deviates from MasterFormat scope or combines work results differently, that should be an exception – in general, follow the MasterFormat classification for where content belongs. By conforming to MasterFormat, UFGS sections integrate smoothly into project manuals and allow easy cross-reference to commercial specifications and estimators’ catalogs.

3. **SpecsIntact Section Template and Format:** UFGS are authored and maintained using **SpecsIntact**, a specialized specification software. Always use the official UFGS SpecsIntact **section template (.SEC)** when creating or editing a guide spec. The template enforces standard page layout, formatting of paragraph numbering and indentation, fonts, and imbedded informational tags. According to UFC 1-300-02, the SpecsIntact template ensures consistency in **headers, footers, page numbers, and basic elements** across all UFGS sections. For example, SpecsIntact will automatically generate the section header which contains the section number and date, and a footer with page numbering in the format “Page X” etc., which should not be altered manually. The body text font in published UFGS PDFs is typically Times New Roman 11 pt per NASA template defaults (though it may appear differently in the editing interface). Do **not** introduce custom fonts or styles; stick to the template’s styles for headings (SpecsIntact has styles for Part title, Article title, etc.). Maintain the automatic paragraph and subparagraph numbering – do not hardcode numbers. The SpecsIntact files are in **XML format (.SEC)** and can be output to PDF or Word if needed. Always keep the master file in .SEC format. Before publishing an updated UFGS, use SpecsIntact’s **Quality Control tools**: run the **Report Reference** and **Report Submittals** functions to ensure all reference tags (RID) and submittal tags (SID) are correctly paired with listings in Part 1. The **SpecsIntact QuickStart Guide** (NASA) is a helpful reference for new spec writers, as cited in UFC 1-300-02. In summary, leverage SpecsIntact to handle formatting and avoid using non-standard document editors that could break the UFGS format. The result will be a section that is perfectly in line with the UFGS formatting standards and can be readily integrated into the DoD spec system.

4. **Numerical Hierarchy and Paragraph Numbering (UFGS):** UFGS sections follow a **decimal numbering system** for parts, articles, and paragraphs that is slightly different from UFC paragraph numbering. The numbering format is prescribed by SpecsIntact and CSI SectionFormat: **Parts** are numbered with an integer (“1.”, “2.”, “3.” corresponding to Part 1, 2, 3) but typically the word “PART” is used in headings instead of the number alone. **First-level paragraphs** under each part (often called **Articles**) are numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. within Part 1; 2.1, 2.2, etc. in Part 2; 3.1, 3.2, etc. in Part 3. **Second-level paragraphs** are 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc., and so on up to six levels deep if necessary. An example outline might be:

   * 1. **GENERAL**
        1.1 Summary
        1.2 References
        1.3 Submittals
        1.3.1 SD-01 Preconstruction Submittals
        1.3.2 SD-03 Product Data
        …
        1.4 Quality Assurance
        1.5 Delivery, Storage, and Handling
   * 2. **PRODUCTS**
        2.1 Materials
        2.1.1 Cement
        2.1.2 Aggregates
        2.2 Accessories
        2.3 Mixes
   * 3. **EXECUTION**
        3.1 Examination
        3.2 Preparation
        3.2.1 Surface Preparation
        3.3 Installation
        3.3.1 Placement
        3.3.2 Finishing
        3.4 Field Quality Control
        3.5 Cleanup
        This is illustrative; actual article names vary by section type. The key is that **each paragraph at every level is numbered** and that the numbering restarts in each part (i.e., Part 2’s first article is 2.1 even if Part 1 ended with 1.10). The SpecsIntact “QuickStart Guide Numeric” details how the auto-numbering is applied. It is critical not to modify these numbers arbitrarily – use the SpecsIntact tagging (`<PRT>`, `<SPT>`) to create new numbered paragraphs so the software can manage the numbering. Also, do not skip numbers. If content is removed, the remaining items should be renumbered sequentially (SpecsIntact will do this when you delete a paragraph tag). The numeric hierarchy must correspond to the indenture level: SpecsIntact will indent subparagraphs automatically. In printed/PDF format, first-level article titles are typically left-justified and in all caps, with subsequent levels indented (about 0.3 inches per level) and in title case, following CSI PageFormat guidelines (the exact indent is handled by the SpecsIntact template). Ensure that **each numbered subpart has a title** following the rules: Part titles are uppercase (“PART 1 GENERAL”), Article (level 1 paragraph) titles are uppercase, and subparagraph titles (levels 2 and beyond) are title case. Every paragraph should either be followed by lower-level paragraphs or contain text (or both). If a heading is empty (no content and no subparts), remove it or supply the needed content. Limit the depth of indentation – while up to six levels are allowed, using that many is seldom desirable; try to consolidate if you find more than 3–4 levels. And as with UFCs, **never have a lone subparagraph** – if you have 2.2.1, you should have a 2.2.2 at minimum (the SpecsIntact QC will flag a lone subparagraph as an error). By carefully observing the numbering conventions, the UFGS will be structured for easy reference, and contract editors (designers) will be able to add or delete options without breaking the numbering.

5. **Titles of Articles and Paragraphs (UFGS):** Just like UFCs, **every numbered paragraph in a UFGS must have a descriptive title**. CSI SectionFormat provides recommended article titles for common content (e.g., “References, Submittals, Quality Assurance, Field Conditions, etc.,” in Part 1; “Materials, Accessories, Source Quality Control,” etc., in Part 2; “Preparation, Erection, Field Quality Control,” etc., in Part 3). Use those standard titles where applicable to maintain consistency across all sections. Formatting of titles in UFGS is as follows: **Part titles** (“PART 1 GENERAL”) are centered and all caps; **first-level article titles** (1.1, 1.2, etc.) are all caps and flush left; **lower-level paragraph titles** are sentence case or title case (the UFGS guide indicates first level subparts use uppercase, subsequent subparts use title case). In practice, within SpecsIntact, you typically input titles normally and the software will render level 2+ titles in Title Case. For example:

   * 1.3 **SUBMITTALS** (all caps, a first-level article)
   * 1.3.1 **SD-01 Preconstruction Submittals** (title case, since it’s a subparagraph of an article)
   * 3.2 **PREPARATION** (all caps, first-level article in Part 3)
   * 3.2.2 **Surface Preparation** (title case, second-level subparagraph).
     Titles should be brief but specific. Do not simply title a paragraph “General” or “Miscellaneous.” Instead, reflect the content – e.g., use “Installation of Equipment” rather than just “Installation” if only equipment installation is discussed. End each title with a period in the SpecsIntact editor (the software will manage spacing). The UFGS format standard explicitly requires **each numbered subpart to have a title** – do not leave any heading number with just text following on the same line. If a paragraph is a continuation of the topic from its parent and truly doesn’t need a separate title, consider merging it with the parent instead of leaving it untitled. SpecsIntact enforces titles for main paragraphs, but it is possible to create an untitled subparagraph (e.g., using the “Note” style or something); avoid that except for the built-in “NOTE” or “TAILORING OPTION” placeholders which are handled differently. By titling everything appropriately, you ensure clarity: a contractor or designer scanning the spec can grasp the structure and find needed info quickly. Additionally, these titles will appear in the automatically generated table of contents of a project manual if one is made, so they must be meaningful and unique within the section.

6. **Content of Part 1 – General Requirements:** Follow UFGS guidelines for typical **Part 1 content**. There are certain standard articles that usually appear (depending on the section’s needs):

   * **References:** List all **reference standards/publications** cited in the section under an article usually titled “REFERENCES” (often numbered 1.2 or 1.3, typically right after Summary). In SpecsIntact, use reference tags (RID) in the text when referencing standards (e.g., “\[ASTM C33]”) and the software will compile them into Part 1 automatically or via the Reference Wizard. The list of references in Part 1 should match those tags. *Do not include references that are not actually cited.* Each reference entry should include the standard designation and title (and possibly date) – SpecsIntact pulls this from the Unified Master Reference List (UMRL) database. The UFC 1-300-02 format requires that reference identifiers appear in **bold text within parentheses** in the body (which SpecsIntact handles) and that all references used in the section are listed in the References article. Keep the formatting of the reference list consistent. This central References article in each UFGS allows easy updating of standard versions using the SpecsIntact Reference Wizard.
   * **Submittals:** Every UFGS section should have a **Submittals** article (usually numbered 1.4 or similar) that enumerates the **submittal requirements** for that section. Use the standard UFGS Submittal Descriptions (SD numbers) as defined in UFGS Section 01 33 00 “Submittal Procedures”. For example, typical categories include *SD-01 Preconstruction Submittals, SD-02 Shop Drawings, SD-03 Product Data, SD-04 Samples, SD-05 Design Data, SD-06 Test Reports, SD-07 Certificates, SD-08 Manufacturer’s Instructions, SD-09 Field Reports, SD-10 O\&M Data, SD-11 Closeout Submittals*, etc.. Under each relevant SD category, list the specific items to be submitted. For instance: “**SD-02 Shop Drawings –** Layout drawings of equipment; **SD-03 Product Data –** Manufacturer’s catalog data for pumps; **SD-05 Design Data –** Pump selection calculations.” After each item, indicate the required action: either **“G” for Government approval** or “FIO”/nothing for For Information Only, as applicable. *If* Army-specific, include the RMS submittal reviewer codes in parentheses after G (e.g., “G, AE” meaning Government approval by the Administrative Contracting Officer/Engineer). As noted in UFC 1-300-02, Army projects use RMS which can track submittals by those reviewer codes (Architect-Engineer, District Office, etc.), while Navy/Air Force do not – therefore the guide spec must list the codes for Army in UFGS text (often the SpecsIntact Job will insert them based on project service). Do not include those codes for Navy/USAF, and do not include any “G” designation if a submittal is only for information. Use clear terminology for submittal items (match the item names used in the text or drawings). The Submittals article is crucial for ensuring contractors know what documents/deliverables to provide, so make it comprehensive. Also, coordinate that every submittal listed here is actually mentioned or required somewhere in Parts 2 or 3 of the section (and vice versa; don’t ask for a submittal that isn’t later discussed).
   * **Quality Assurance / Quality Control:** Include a **Quality Assurance** article if needed, numbered in Part 1 (often 1.5). This might specify qualifications for installers, certifications required, mockups, regulatory requirements, or a requirement that certain standards or codes are to be followed by contractors beyond the technical specs in Part 3. If the section involves complex work, you may have a **Preinstallation Meetings** paragraph or similar here. Keep Part 1 QA focused on general requirements (e.g. “Welder qualifications shall conform to AWS D1.1”) rather than execution inspections (testing goes in Part 3).
   * **Delivery, Storage, and Handling:** If applicable, include a paragraph about how products should be delivered and stored on site (e.g. “Deliver materials in original packaging; store indoors in dry conditions,” etc.). This is Part 1 content because it’s not a permanent requirement on the work but an administrative directive.
   * **Project/Site Conditions:** If the work is weather sensitive, include **Environmental Conditions** or **Field Conditions** (e.g. “Do not install roofing if ambient temperature is below X”).
   * **Sequencing/Scheduling:** Sometimes used to indicate required order of operations relative to other work (if not covered in Division 01).
   * **Design Constraints:** For design-build specs, Part 1 might have design criteria (though usually performance specs are separate UFGS sections; still, any design submittal requirements or performance criteria can be Part 1).
   * Avoid putting technical requirements (material properties, installation methods) in Part 1. Those belong in Parts 2 and 3. Part 1 sets the stage and administrative framework for the section. Adhering to standard Part 1 articles (as provided by SectionFormat and UFGS guidance) ensures consistency. CSI’s SectionFormat provides an outline of typical Part 1 headings, and UFGS often reflect that. Tailor Part 1 to include only what is needed – extraneous headings (like “System Description” or “Definitions”) should appear only if the specific content requires it. For example, include a **Definitions** article if the section uses special terminology that needs defining for the contractor. Keep Part 1 concise and focused on requirements that aren’t tied to a single product but rather apply section-wide.

7. **Content of Part 2 – Products:** Use Part 2 to specify all materials, equipment, components, mixes, or assemblies that this section provides. **Group products by type or system** in a logical order. Typically, start with the primary product or material, then ancillary components, then finishes or accessories, then source quality control:

   * **Material specifications:** For each major material, provide either a reference to a standard (e.g. “Cement: ASTM C150, Type I”) or specific performance criteria. If multiple classes or types exist, specify which (e.g., “Valve bodies shall be bronze, ASTM B62”).
   * **Manufactured units:** Identify approved manufacturers or acceptable product models if necessary. Generally, UFGS avoids proprietary specifications; if listing manufacturers, list at least two or say “or approved equal” in accordance with FAR 52.236-5 (to ensure competition). Often it’s better to describe performance and allow any product meeting it. If including model numbers or trade names, ensure compliance with UFGS policy (usually discouraged unless vital, and then must allow substitutions).
   * **Accessories and secondary items:** Provide requirements for subordinate items like fasteners, seals, gaskets that are needed for a complete installation, under an “ACCESSORIES” or similarly titled paragraph.
   * **Mixes:** If on-site mixes are required (concrete mix, soil mix, etc.), include mix proportions or performance criteria in a “Mixes” paragraph. (Mixing procedures themselves might belong in Part 3 unless the mix is essentially a manufacturing process.)
   * **Fabrication or Pre-assembly:** If the section involves custom fabrication (like structural steel or ductwork), include fabrication requirements in Part 2, since it pertains to how the product is made before arriving at site. This can include workmanship, tolerances, shop coatings, etc.
   * **Source Quality Control:** If tests or inspections are to be done at the manufacturer’s plant or before delivery (e.g., factory test of a generator), specify those in Part 2, often under a “SOURCE QUALITY CONTROL” article, to differentiate from field quality control in Part 3. However, coordination with the Submittals article is needed – typically, source QC results are delivered as submittals (e.g. test reports).
   * Ensure that for every material or product, you either directly specify it or reference a standard that specifies it. Avoid open-ended phrases like “use high quality materials” – instead define “quality” via standards or properties.
   * **No execution in Part 2:** Do not include installation methods or directions here. For example, Part 2 might say “Reinforcing Steel: ASTM A615, Grade 60,” but the placement of that rebar (spacing, laps) belongs in Part 3.
   * Try to maintain the order recommended by CSI: often, Part 2 starts with **Systems** or assemblies, then individual components, then accessories, then finishes, then fabrication, then source QC. In any case, be consistent within a spec series.
   * Use consistent units and terminology as defined (if Part 1 defined certain terms, use them exactly in Part 2 and 3).
   * Part 2 is essentially the “shopping list” of what materials and equipment are required to fulfill the contract for that section. It should be exhaustive enough that no unspecified materials are needed to complete the work (except those covered in other sections). It sets the quality baseline that will be enforced via submittals and inspections.
   * When writing UFGS Part 2, guide spec writers often consult manufacturer data and industry standards; ensure not to copy any proprietary text directly. Summarize the performance or select key criteria that matter to the government (durability, maintainability, compatibility, etc.).
   * If UFGS content differs among services (Army/Navy/Air Force) in Part 2 (for example, one service prefers a different material), use **tailoring tags** or bracketed options to accommodate both – see tailoring guidance (item 9 below) for how to implement service-specific differences without creating separate specs.

8. **Content of Part 3 – Execution:** Use Part 3 to clearly delineate how the products from Part 2 are to be incorporated into the work. It typically contains:

   * **Preparation:** Requirements for preparing the substrate or work area prior to installation. This might include verifying previous work (e.g., “Verify dimensions and alignment of anchors installed under Section 05 50 00”), cleaning surfaces, protecting adjacent construction, environmental requirements during work (e.g., temperature or humidity limitations during application), and so on. If existing work must be demolished or modified, references to those actions (or to related spec sections) can be included.
   * **Installation / Application / Erection:** Detailed instructions for installing the product. Use imperative mood and describe the desired outcome rather than step-by-step contractor means unless necessary. For example: “Install fence posts plumb and spaced at 10 feet on center” – this specifies the result and critical parameters, without dictating exactly how the contractor achieves plumb. If specific methods are critical (e.g., welding standards, tightening torque, sequence of tightening bolts), include those. You may break this into multiple paragraphs or subparagraphs for clarity, especially if different components have different installation methods (for instance, an “Installation of Ductwork” vs “Installation of Equipment” paragraphs within an HVAC spec).
   * **Field Quality Control:** Define inspections, tests, or demonstrations that occur after installation to verify the work meets requirements. This might call for the contractor to perform certain tests (like concrete cylinder tests, or electrical circuit testing) and for results to be submitted (often as test reports under SD-06). Alternatively, it might state that a government representative will perform certain inspections (though typically contractor performs QC and government does QA verification). If specialized testing agencies or laboratories are required (e.g. for soils compaction or weld X-ray), state that here. Clearly tie these to acceptance criteria (e.g., “if test fails, remedial measures …”).
   * **Adjustment and Cleanup:** After installation, any tuning, adjusting, aligning, balancing (for systems), etc., should be required. For example, a mechanical spec might say “Balance the HVAC system per Section 23 05 93.” A door spec might say “Adjust doors for proper operation.” Also include removal of debris, cleaning of surfaces, touch-up painting of damaged finishes, etc., in a “Cleaning” or “Closeout Activities” paragraph.
   * **Training or Documentation:** If the section requires the contractor to train facility staff or provide extra stock materials, put those requirements in Part 3 (or Part 1 if it’s administrative). For example, “3.6 TRAINING: Provide 2 hours of instruction to owner’s personnel on operation and maintenance of the system.” or “Furnish maintenance manuals under Section 01 78 23.”
   * **Coordination Notes:** Avoid duplicating Division 01 provisions in Part 3. For example, don’t rewrite safety requirements that are covered by general conditions or project safety specs. Focus on the technical execution.
   * Use **tailoring** or **brackets** if different services have different execution preferences (though execution is usually standard).
   * All requirements in Part 3 should be enforceable and measurable. Words like “thoroughly” or “carefully” should be avoided unless you can quantify them or they are self-evident. Instead of “carefully backfill,” specify compaction requirements for backfill.
   * Ensure Part 3 aligns with Part 2: e.g., if Part 2 says “Provide equipment X with Y feature,” Part 3 should have any needed instructions to install or test feature Y.
   * **Avoid Means and Methods**: While writing Part 3, recall that the contractor is responsible for means and methods. You specify *results* and standards. Do not prescribe exactly which tools to use or labor steps unless it’s critical to outcome (e.g., “Apply coating with a stiff brush” might be necessary if spraying won’t achieve required thickness).
   * Every action in Part 3 can be tied to an outcome that the Government will accept or reject. This ensures enforceability in the field.
   * Use subheadings liberally in Part 3 to break up different phases or components of work. For example, you may have “3.3 APPLICATION – PAINTING” and then separate paragraphs for “Primer Application,” “Finish Coat Application,” etc., if it aids clarity.
   * If a design-build tailoring is included (some UFGS allow an execution section to have alternate text if it's a design-build project vs a design-bid-build), ensure those options are clearly tagged (see tailoring, item 9).
   * Part 3, along with Part 2, is often the most scrutinized by contractors since it dictates what they must do on site. It should be unambiguous, technically sound, and as concise as possible while covering all necessary criteria.

9. **Tailoring Options (Service-Specific or Project-Specific):** UFGS sections often incorporate **tailoring options** to allow spec editors to include or exclude text for certain project conditions or agency requirements. Tailoring is implemented in SpecsIntact via special tags `<TAI>` that mark blocks of text to be included or excluded based on choices made when creating a project specification. According to UFC 1-300-02:

   * Use tailoring for significant **Service-specific differences** when a unified approach isn’t possible. For example, if the Navy has a different testing requirement than the Army for a given material, rather than maintaining two separate UFGS sections, a tailoring tag can be used to toggle the relevant paragraphs for Navy projects. Master UFGS writers are directed to reconcile requirements as much as possible, and only use separate tailored text where absolutely necessary. If only one service has an extra requirement, that portion can be within a <TAI> tag labeled for that service.
   * Do **not** use tailoring and brackets for the exact same decision – choose one method. Generally, use **brackets** for small choices *within* a paragraph (like choosing a word or value), and use **tailoring** for larger blocks of text or whole paragraphs that are optional or vary by project type/service. For instance, you wouldn’t have one sentence half in one tailoring option and half in another; you’d bracket the small variation within one sentence, but if an entire sentence or paragraph is only needed for a certain case, tailor it.
   * Include a **Note to the Designer** before tailored sections to explain the criteria for selecting the tailored options. SpecsIntact uses **Note** tags (which appear in the printed spec as italicized notes or are removed entirely, depending on settings) to give guidance. For example: *“NOTE: Use the following paragraph for Air Force projects only.”* followed by the tailored Air Force paragraph within `<TAI>` markers. These notes should be marked as non-contractual (they are automatically removed when printing final specs for construction). They serve the spec editor in choosing the right options.
   * Tailoring options in SpecsIntact are normally presented with labels (like “OPT1”, “OPT2” or by service name). Ensure each tailored block is clearly labeled in the editor for what condition it’s for. For service-specific, the convention is sometimes to label them with the service (ARMY, NAVY, AF, NASA).
   * For **Design-Build vs Design-Bid-Build** differences: Some UFGS include tailoring to differentiate requirements for projects that are design-build (contractor is producing final design) versus traditional design-bid-build. If the section has design-related submittals or criteria, those might be toggled on for DB and off for DBB. UFC 1-300-02 suggests using tailoring tags for design-only requirements in design-build scenarios. The master may have, for instance, two tailored subparagraphs: one labeled “Design-Build” and one “Design-Bid-Build” under a given article, each with different content appropriate to each delivery method. Additionally, service-specific tailoring can be combined – the UFC suggests structuring tailoring such that you could choose e.g. “Air Force Design-Build” vs “Air Force Design-Bid-Build” etc., as separate options. The Change 3 to UFC 1-300-02 provided a template of tailoring options for each service & delivery method (listing Air Force DB, Air Force DBB, Army DB, Army DBB, Navy DB, etc.). Follow that model if applicable: ensure the tailored text makes clear which combination it applies to.
   * **Formatting tailored text:** The UFC guidance suggests to write tailored option text as complete sentences or paragraphs, rather than bracketing individual words within a sentence for tailoring. For example, better to have two separate sentences each within its own <TAI OPT> tag (“Use galvanized steel.” versus “Use stainless steel.”) than to try to toggle just the word (“Use <TAI>galvanized</TAI><TAI OPT>stainless</TAI> steel.”). This improves clarity especially when someone is reading a version of the spec not using SpecsIntact (like a plain PDF – tailored text might appear all together, so it should still read logically in that form).
   * When saving a UFGS to a project, the specifier will be prompted to select which tailoring options to apply. So, ensure the master has all needed options encapsulated. Do not leave stray references like “for Army:” in the text; they should be either in notes or only shown when that option is selected.
   * Test the section by printing with different tailoring selections to verify it reads correctly in each scenario. The master should default to including all text (with tags indicating optional parts).
   * Document in the section’s **lead-in note** (usually a note at the very top of the section) what tailoring options exist. Many UFGS start with a Note listing available tailoring choices to guide the spec editor.
   * Example: *“NOTE: This guide specification contains tailoring options for Army, Navy and Air Force project variations. Select the appropriate options as required.”* Then throughout the text, notes before tailored groups might say, *“(Army only)”*, *“(Navy only)”*, etc.
   * Following these practices ensures that a single UFGS can serve multiple masters and project situations without manual re-write, simply by the user activating the correct options.

10. **Optional Text and Bracketed Options:** Use **brackets** to indicate minor choices or project-specific values that the spec editor must fill in or select. Brackets in UFGS serve two main purposes: (a) to offer a choice among discrete options, or (b) to denote a blank to be filled with a project-specific value.

    * **Choice Options:** When two or more alternative words or phrases could apply, place them in brackets separated by a slash or in separate bracket tags within the SpecsIntact editor. For example: *“Provide \[galvanized steel] \[stainless steel] duct hangers.”* The instruction to the editor (often given in a preceding Note) would be to choose the appropriate material. According to UFC 1-300-02, arrange multiple choices in the order of most likely or most commonly used first. In the example, if galvanized is more common, list it first. This gives a default bias toward the typical choice. Only include realistic options – don’t list unnecessary alternatives. If more than two or three options, consider whether tailoring (larger optional paragraphs) might be more appropriate or if some options can be eliminated by specifying performance.
    * **Fill-in Blanks:** Use an underscored blank within brackets like **\[\_\_\_\_\_ ]** to indicate the specifier needs to input a value or information. Typically five underscore characters are used to make the blank noticeable. Examples: *“Design Pressure: \[\_\_\_\_\_] kPa.”* or *“Color: \[\_\_\_\_\_].”* A corresponding Note should instruct what to fill in (e.g., “NOTE: Insert design pressure as required.”). Only leave blanks for information that *must* come from the project designer and cannot be known by the guide spec writer (like site-specific data, project name, etc.). Keep blanks to a minimum; overuse can lead to omissions. Make sure blanks are obvious in the final document if not filled – to avoid that, the spec editor must fill them in. It’s good practice in the SpecsIntact review to search for “\_\_\_\_\_” to ensure none remain before finalizing a project spec.
    * **Using Brackets vs Tailoring:** Use brackets for simpler variations *within a sentence or clause*. If the optional text spans multiple sentences or fundamentally changes the structure of the requirements, use tailoring tags instead (with a Note as discussed). Brackets should not contain large paragraphs; that’s better handled by tailoring or notes for the spec editor to manually add content if needed.
    * **Mutually exclusive vs multiple selection:** If only one of the bracketed options is to be selected, the Note should clarify “choose one of the options.” If more than one could apply, perhaps listing them with “and/or” might be needed or splitting into separate requirements. Avoid ambiguity in bracketed choices.
    * **No double nesting:** Don’t nest brackets inside brackets or have an option that itself contains another bracket – this confuses the spec editor. If such complexity is needed, break into separate sentences or use tailoring.
    * **Designer Notes for Brackets:** Provide a **Note to the Designer** immediately before a bracketed choice when guidance is needed on how to choose. For example, *“NOTE: Retain first option for indoor installations, second option for outdoor installations.”* This note will not be printed in the final spec (since it’s a note), but guides the editor in making the correct selection.
    * **Default if not edited:** Ideally, bracketed text should not be left in final form. However, assume an inattentive editor might leave the brackets with both options. To mitigate resulting confusion, phrasing can be crafted such that if both remain, it still makes some sense, or the more common default is first. But ultimately the onus is on the spec preparer to edit properly. For blanks, if left blank, that’s clearly incomplete.
    * **Not Both Brackets and Tailoring for Same Issue:** As noted, do not use a tailoring option and then also brackets within it to address the same decision – simplify it. For example, if a paragraph is only for Navy and within it there’s a slight variant for Atlantic vs Pacific, you could either bracket those minor differences or create two tailored paragraphs (Navy Atlantic, Navy Pacific). Decide which is clearer to the user. Generally, if the difference is small, use brackets within the Navy-tailored paragraph.
    * Following these bracket conventions, an editor using the UFGS will know exactly where they have discretion to make project-specific changes. It embeds flexibility while preserving the baseline text. Always double-check that bracketed options cover all likely project conditions; if not, additional guidance or options may be needed. Brackets, combined with tailoring and notes, make the UFGS a versatile tool that can be adapted to varied project needs without rewriting from scratch.

11. **Submittal Register Coordination:** UFGS sections are used in conjunction with a **unified submittal process**. Ensure that each submittal item listed in Part 1 aligns with the contract deliverables needed. In particular:

    * Follow the definitions in **Section 01 33 00 SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES** for what each SD category means. For example, SD-05 “Design Data” is typically calculations or design assumptions the contractor must submit; SD-07 “Certificates” might be manufacturer certifications of compliance, etc. Don’t create custom submittal categories; use the existing ones.
    * Use the correct format for submittal listing: **Submittal Description – Item; Classification**. The standard format is to list the submittal description (like SD-03 Product Data) followed by a dash and then the specific item name(s). If a submittal requires Government approval, put “G” after the item (and reviewer codes for Army as needed). If it’s FIO, no letter is needed (or sometimes “FIO” is explicitly noted in some templates – but typically absence of G means for information).
    * Ensure the items are worded exactly as referenced in the section text to avoid confusion. For example, if Part 2 says “Transformer” as a product, the submittal should say “Product Data – Transformer; G”.
    * According to the “Unification Issues” note in UFC 1-300-02, because submittal processes aren’t unified across Army, Navy, Air Force, the UFGS must accommodate differences in notation. This primarily affects how we annotate submittals: Army requires using RMS codes after the “G” (like G, “AE” for Architect-Engineer to review, etc.). UFGS sections typically include all three services’ submittal needs by listing the items once with a generic “G” and using a **tailoring or note** to add Army-specific codes when used on Army projects. In practice, if using SpecsIntact for an Army job, the software can insert the applicable codes if configured with an Army project template. For the guide spec itself, it might include an explanatory note or placeholder for those codes. The key point: the section’s submittal list must be compatible with each service’s process – meaning no submittal item should be impossible or irrelevant for one service.
    * The **Unified Master Reference List (UMRL)** also includes a **Unified Master Submittal List (UMSL)** concept, where typical submittals for each section are identified. Ensure your submittals align with what’s expected. For example, most material sections will have at least Product Data submittals; testable items often have Test Reports submittals.
    * All submittals should tie to verification in Part 3 or elsewhere. E.g., if “Test Reports – Concrete compression tests; G” is listed, then Part 3’s Field Quality Control should describe that testing. Conversely, if Part 3 calls for a test or inspection, ensure a corresponding submittal (test report or certificate) is listed so the contractor formally provides the results.
    * If certain submittals are required only under specific conditions (like an optional feature), link them via tailoring or notes. For example, if an “Operation and Maintenance Data (SD-10)” submittal is only required if maintenance is part of the contract, you may tailor that submittal to design-build projects or to projects including equipment that requires O\&M manuals.
    * The **ENG Form 4288** (Submittal Register form) is typically used by contractors to track submittals; make sure the nomenclature in the UFGS is concise for entry in such forms (the first few words of the item should identify it clearly).
    * Lastly, do not include procedural details in the Submittals article – those are covered in Section 01 33 00. The UFGS should only identify WHAT must be submitted; the when and how is governed by the Division 01 process. For design-build, sometimes the spec will require a design document submittal at a certain stage; list it here (e.g., “SD-01 Preconstruction Submittals – Design Drawings; G” for a design-build spec requiring the contractor’s design).
    * By getting the submittals list right, you ensure that contract administration is smooth and the government gets all the documentation needed to verify compliance. This is a critical part of UFGS writing, as indicated by the UFC change document referencing it as a notable unification issue to pay attention to.

12. **Compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and DoD Policies:** UFGS are part of contract documents, so they must comply with overarching procurement regulations. A few key points:

    * **Proprietary References:** Avoid naming proprietary products or brands unless accompanied by “or approved equal” and authorized by FAR 6.302 (which generally requires justification). When possible, describe by performance and standard rather than brand. If specific manufacturers are listed (for instance in some UFGS, a basis-of-design may be given), ensure at least two names are provided followed by “or equal”, to uphold competition. Some UFGS include a Note like “NOTE: Where manufacturer names are used, ensure that at least three are listed to comply with FAR.”
    * **Standards and Codes:** As mentioned, use the latest editions unless explicitly stated otherwise. FAR typically requires using updated standards unless a specific contract stipulates a version. UFGS should thus always refer to current standards (the UMRL is kept current for this reason).
    * **Metrication:** Per DoD policy (and referenced in UFC 1-300-02), specifications should be dual-unit. The UFGS masters are written with dual units and the SpecsIntact system facilitates that. Ensure you do not remove metric units in the master text. If a specific project is using imperial only, the spec editor will use SpecsIntact to drop metric via job settings, but the master must show both with metric first as required.
    * **Environmental/Energy Requirements:** Many UFGS incorporate sustainability requirements (e.g., low VOC materials, energy efficiency standards) as mandated by UFC 1-200-02 (High Performance and Sustainable Building Requirements). Ensure these are included where relevant. Also, if writing new UFGS content, consider if FAR clauses (like requiring recycled content per EPA guidelines) impact the spec and incorporate those requirements in Part 2 or Part 3 as applicable (with appropriate references).
    * **Accessibility / Safety:** If the product or installation is subject to accessibility standards (ABA Standards) or safety codes (OSHA requirements), ensure compliance language is in the spec. Often Division 01 covers general code compliance, but if specific to an item (like playground equipment safety standards or elevator code), cite it.
    * **Coordination with FAR Division 01 clauses:** UFGS sections shouldn’t conflict with project contract clauses. For instance, do not put warranty durations in a technical section that contradict the contract’s warranty clause. If an extended warranty is needed, coordinate with appropriate procurement channels. Many UFGS simply require a certificate of warranty and refer to contract conditions. If you specify something like “provide 5-year warranty,” ensure it’s allowable.
    * Always be aware that UFGS become legal contract documents. Wording should be enforceable and not conflict with law or regulation. When in doubt, consult FAR Part 11 (Describing Agency Needs) which covers how to write specifications, and MIL-STD-3007 which provides the policy for UFC/UFGS (e.g., requirement for tri-service coordination, which is beyond spec text content but part of process).
    * The MIL-STD-3007 provides the overall framework for UFGS as part of the DoD Standardization program. While writing the spec, ensure you are following that standard practice (which essentially is what UFC 1-300-02 encapsulates). For example, it emphasizes using non-government standards where possible and maintaining UFGS in a unified manner – which we have covered through references and tailoring.
    * In summary, UFGS authors must produce specifications that not only meet technical needs but also abide by procurement rules (open competition, clarity, and no conflicts with contractual provisions). This ensures the resulting construction contracts are legally sound and fair.

By meticulously applying the above UFGS-specific standards, guide specification writers will create documents that are **uniformly formatted**, **technically comprehensive**, and **easy for project teams to edit** for their specific needs. Adhering to the CSI formats and UFGS policies yields specifications that contractors can follow without confusion, thereby facilitating successful construction outcomes.

## 4. Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) Best Practices Summary

**CSI’s MasterFormat and SectionFormat/PageFormat standards underpin the organization and language of UFGS sections and provide best practices applicable to all construction specifications**. The following principles, distilled from the CSI Manual of Practice and Project Delivery/Construction Specifications Practice Guides, represent industry best practices that UFGS and UFC writers should follow:

1. **Follow the MasterFormat Divisions and Numbering System:** CSI MasterFormat® is the nationally recognized indexing of work results; it divides construction information into divisions (00–49) and assigns section numbers and titles to each type of work (e.g., Division 03 Concrete, Section 03 30 00 Cast-in-Place Concrete). Always classify specification sections according to MasterFormat so that project manuals have a consistent order and trades can easily find relevant sections. MasterFormat ensures that specs align with industry norms (e.g., all painting requirements in Division 09 Finishes) and facilitates coordination among design disciplines. Using MasterFormat numbering also helps avoid overlap between sections – each subject should be covered in one place. CSI updates MasterFormat periodically; spec writers must use the **latest version** (as UFGS does per UFC 1-300-02) to incorporate any new section numbers or title changes for emerging technologies.

2. **Implement SectionFormat’s Three-Part Structure:** CSI’s SectionFormat™ dictates that every specification section be divided into **Part 1 – General, Part 2 – Products, Part 3 – Execution**, which UFGS adheres to. This structure is considered best practice because it organizes information by its nature: Part 1 communicates administrative and reference information (applicable to the whole section), Part 2 details the technical quality of materials and products, and Part 3 describes how to install or implement those products. Following this structure consistently across all sections makes it **easier for contractors and design professionals to navigate specs**. For instance, a contractor knows that if they need to find submittal requirements or definitions, they go to Part 1 of the section; if they need to know material properties, check Part 2; if looking for installation or testing procedures, see Part 3. This consistency improves usability and reduces miscommunication. SectionFormat also provides a **recommended arrangement of articles within each part** – for example, Part 1 is typically arranged with Summary or Scope first, then References, Definitions (if any), Submittals, Quality Assurance, Delivery/Storage, Site Conditions, etc., in a logical flow. Similarly, Part 3 often follows the sequence of operations: preparation, installation/application, field quality control, and closeout. Adhering to these recommended orders (as much as fits the section’s needs) makes the spec more readable and logically sequenced.

3. **Use Clear, Consistent, and Concise Language:** CSI emphasizes the “Four C’s” of specification writing – make the text **Clear, Concise, Correct,** and **Complete**.

   * **Clear:** Use straightforward language and simple sentence structure so that requirements cannot be misinterpreted. Avoid convoluted sentences; break long sentences into list items or multiple sentences for clarity. Define any technical terms that might be unclear (preferably in a Definitions article). Use words consistently (don’t call the same item “equipment” in one place and “machinery” in another – pick one term and stick to it). Ensure that any abbreviations are defined so there’s no ambiguity.
   * **Concise:** Do not include extraneous information or narrative. Specifications are not textbooks – they should not explain construction methodology or theory except as necessary for context. Avoid redundancy; do not repeat requirements in multiple sections (cross-reference instead if needed). Also, avoid including installation advice that is obvious to any qualified contractor (e.g., “use proper tools” or “work carefully”). Conciseness helps keep the focus on enforceable requirements. CSI best practice is to **“say it once and in the right place.”** This means each piece of information should appear only once in the contract documents – either in the specs or on drawings or in a code reference – to avoid contradictions. If it’s on the drawings (like dimensions or locations), don’t repeat in specs; if it’s in one spec section, don’t duplicate in another.
   * **Correct:** Ensure technical accuracy. This involves verifying that referenced standards are current and applicable, that specified materials are available and appropriate for their intended use, and that all code requirements are met. Use proper units and conversion (CSI encourages using SI units in design; UFGS uses dual units). Check spelling of technical terms and names of agencies (CSI’s formats provide standardized references to organizations – use those to cite standards correctly). Also, align spec requirements with design intent – if drawings show one thing and specs say another, that’s a correctness issue. Thorough coordination is part of correctness.
   * **Complete:** Specifications should cover all aspects of the work necessary to ensure a complete and functional result. Don’t leave out needed information assuming “the contractor should know” – if it’s important to quality or performance, specify it. Conversely, do not include scope that isn’t actually part of the project. Each spec section should have a clear scope (often outlined in a Summary or Description in Part 1) so that nothing vital is omitted and nothing irrelevant is included. Ensure that all materials and workmanship standards needed are addressed either in the section or by reference. A complete specification combined with drawings should enable a competent contractor to bid and build the project without needing guesswork or unwritten assumptions.
     By following the Four C’s, spec writers produce documents that are easier to understand and less prone to disputes. For example, instead of a verbose paragraph: *“The contractor shall in a workmanlike manner provide a sufficient quantity of the specified product such that the end result meets the functional requirements,”* a clear, concise version would be: *“Provide the specified product in the quantity required to achieve the performance criteria indicated.”* The latter is shorter and more direct. Achieving this clarity often requires revision and editing, which CSI encourages as part of the spec writing process.

4. **Imperative Mood and Streamlined Syntax:** CSI’s recommended writing style for specifications is to use the **imperative mood** and **present tense**, implicitly directed to the contractor, and to avoid phrases like “the Contractor shall.” For example, say “Install doors plumb and level” rather than “The Contractor shall install the doors plumb and level.” This matches UFGS practice and DoD guidance. The imperative is understood as a command in contract language. It makes sentences shorter and more forceful. Similarly, use **streamlined syntax**: omit needless words such as “shall be” – instead of “All bolts shall be stainless steel,” write “Provide stainless steel bolts.” Avoid unnecessary articles (a, an, the) where they don’t add meaning. For instance, “Do not use the symbol ‘Ø’ for diameter” is better than “Do not use the symbol ‘Ø’ for the diameter,” unless specifying a particular instance. Streamlining also means avoid legalese or archaic terms (“herein,” “aforementioned,” etc.). Specifications are legal documents but they should be written in plain English. CSI’s Plain Language Guide for Construction Specs (part of the Practice Guides) aligns with these principles. By using plain, imperative directives, specs reduce the chance of confusion. For example, a CSI mantra is *“Drawings indicate, Specs specify.”* So specs should say **what** to do (in imperative terms) and to what standard, rather than describing methods (which is more the contractor’s means and methods domain unless necessary). Adopting CSI’s language style results in specs that are succinct and unambiguous.

5. **Avoid Ambiguity and Redundancy:** CSI best practices dictate that specifications must not conflict with drawings or within themselves. Use **only one interpretation for each requirement**. Avoid ambiguous terms like “etc.,” “as necessary,” “as applicable,” or “to the satisfaction of the Engineer.” Instead, explicitly state requirements. For example, rather than “install equipment as necessary to ensure proper operation,” specify the criteria: “install equipment in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions to ensure proper operation.” The former leaves “as necessary” up to interpretation, whereas the latter references an objective standard (manufacturer’s instructions). Redundancy can cause contradictions if two places say the same thing differently. CSI advises cross-referencing related requirements instead of repeating. If something is specified in Section 26 00 00 (General Electrical) that affects Section 26 24 16 (Panelboards), refer to it rather than restating, or place it in the correct one and not in the other. If duplication is unavoidable, ensure the wording is identical to prevent discrepancy. Another form of redundancy to avoid is describing means & methods that are common practice – e.g., don’t repeatedly instruct to check dimensions or comply with OSHA – that is understood or covered in general conditions. Focus on the end result. By eliminating ambiguity and redundancy, you create a contract document where there's **only one way to interpret a given requirement**, which reduces RFIs (Requests for Information) and potential change orders.

6. **Coordinate Drawings and Specifications:** The CSI Manual of Practice emphasizes that **specifications and drawings are complementary** – neither supersedes the other, and they must be consistent. Best practice is to use drawings to show dimensions, quantities, and layouts, and use specs to state qualities, performance, and installation requirements. Avoid putting the same information in both. For example, dimensions should only be on drawings; if a spec mentions a dimension, it should be a performance criterion or a fabrication tolerance, not re-stating what the drawing shows. Conversely, if a drawing contains a generic note like “All work to conform to applicable codes,” the spec should have the actual code compliance language – drawings should refer to specs for processes or standards. During editing, perform a thorough coordination review: ensure that every item called for on drawings (doors, equipment, finishes, etc.) has a corresponding specification section, and that nothing is specified that isn’t shown or needed. If drawings label equipment with tags, consider listing those tags in specs or at least ensure nomenclature matches (CSI principle: use same terminology in both – e.g., if drawings say “Chiller-1,” specs should call it “Chiller-1” not “new chiller” generically). Also coordinate between spec sections: e.g., if Division 23 HVAC expects Division 26 Electrical to provide motor starters, make sure Division 26 spec actually includes that. Using **coordination matrices** or spec-checklists (CSI provides some tools) can help. Ultimately, well-coordinated documents reduce contractor confusion and change orders. CSI has a saying: *“The drawings and specs should speak with one voice.”* Achieve that by cross-checking details – for instance, if drawings indicate 3 coats of paint but spec says 2, that discrepancy will cause conflict; correct such inconsistencies in advance.

7. **Include Quality Criteria and Testing Requirements:** CSI best practices recommend clearly specifying how the quality of materials and workmanship will be verified. That means including in specs any required **certifications, mock-ups, inspections, and testing**. For example, if concrete strength is critical, specify compressive strength tests and ASTM standards for frequency. If workmanship on a finish needs a certain standard, require a **mock-up** and describe acceptable quality (CSI SectionFormat allocates a “Quality Assurance” article for qualifications and mockups). Also use **field quality control** articles for tests and inspections (like non-destructive testing of welds). CSI encourages referencing independent standards or **industry references for workmanship** when possible (e.g., “Installation of carpet shall conform to CRI Carpet Installation Standard”). This provides an objective baseline instead of subjective terms like “in a workmanlike manner.” UFGS already incorporate many such references and testing (and UFCs often require compliance with UFC 1-200-01 which invokes model codes for baseline quality). Ensure that every critical performance aspect has some form of verification specified – either submittals (mill certs, lab reports) or on-site tests or inspections. This not only ensures the contractor knows the expectation, but also that the government has a way to confirm compliance. CSI’s Practice Guide suggests aligning spec testing requirements with project **QA/QC processes**, which is done in UFGS by the submittal categories and field quality control parts. Always require results to meet either a referenced standard or a criterion you specify (e.g., “no leakage under 25 psi test pressure”). By embedding clear quality criteria, you ultimately improve the construction outcome and enforceability of the contract.

8. **Separate General Conditions and Division 01 from Technical Specs:** CSI format segregates general contract provisions (conditions of the contract) and general requirements (Division 01) from technical sections (Divisions 02–49). Specification writers should leave topics like **contractor’s means and methods, schedule, payment, or other contractual terms** to the front-end documents (such as the FAR clauses, Division 01 sections, etc.), rather than putting them in technical sections. For example, avoid statements in a technical spec like “The contractor shall complete this work within 30 days” or “cost of testing will be borne by the contractor” – those belong in Division 01 or the contract conditions. Likewise, avoid embedding procedural requirements (like submittal procedures, request for information processes, or temporary facility provisions) in the technical sections – those are covered by Division 01 (UFGS has standardized sections for Submittal Procedures, Construction Schedule, Temporary Facilities, etc.). Technical sections should reference Division 01 for these matters as needed, e.g., “Section 01 33 00 – Submittal Procedures” for submittal process, or “Section 01 45 00 – Quality Control” for QA responsibilities. This ensures no contradictions between a technical spec and a general spec, and allows easier global changes to procedure by editing Division 01 rather than every section. Essentially, **keep technical specs technical** – focus on the product and installation, not contract administration. CSI best practice also advises not to include pricing or cost-related information in specs (that’s for the bidding and contract forms). By maintaining this separation, the specifications remain cleaner and within the expertise of their authors (engineers handle tech specs, contracting officers handle conditions), and if legal language needs changes, it’s confined to the contract/Div 00-01, not the body of technical specs.

9. **Use Standardized Writing Conventions (CSI PageFormat):** CSI’s PageFormat™ provides guidelines for how text should appear on the page for consistency – much of this is already captured in the UFGS template (margins, indents, numbering, fonts, etc.). Key conventions include:

   * Indentations for different paragraph levels (to visually convey hierarchy).
   * All sections start new pages and have a heading with section number and title.
   * Use of a consistent font (often a serif font for body, sans-serif for headings).
   * Use of uppercase vs title case as noted earlier for headings (CSI suggests all caps for article titles for emphasis; UFGS does that for Part titles and Article titles).
   * Placing margin notes or revision bars for changes if needed.
   * Keeping language in the active voice (imperative).
   * Not splitting paragraphs across pages in awkward ways (CSI suggests to avoid leaving a single line of a paragraph at top or bottom of page if possible – commonly called avoiding “widows/orphans”).
     These formatting details, while they may seem minor, contribute to a professional appearance and readability. Standard page layout also aids in electronic processing (like SpecsIntact can parse the structure easily if it follows expected patterns).
     In essence, by conforming to CSI’s recommended format, specifications from different sources end up looking and reading similarly – this is extremely helpful for contractors who may be reading a spec package containing UFGS sections mixed with consultant-created sections; if all follow CSI style, the contractor doesn’t have to adjust to multiple formats.

10. **Ethical and Performance-Oriented Specifications:** CSI best practices encourage specifications to be **performance-oriented** where possible, meaning focus on the **desired results** rather than prescribing exactly how to achieve them, unless necessary for safety or specific outcomes. This leaves room for contractor innovation and means and methods. For example, specify the required flatness of a concrete floor (via an F-number) rather than specifying exactly how to screed and trowel it – the contractor can choose the method to meet the flatness criteria. Another example: specify a paint’s required durability or test standards (scrub cycles, VOC limit) instead of specifying a brand name. The UFGS already lean towards performance specs, but writers should continuously seek to remove unnecessarily prescriptive requirements. That said, some government specs do include prescriptive elements when needed for uniform outcomes across agencies or when mandated by code or criteria. The balance is important.
    Additionally, CSI’s **ethical guidelines** for specifiers warn against biased or closed specifications that unfairly limit competition or that cannot be objectively evaluated. Always provide either multiple acceptable products or a clear performance standard so that multiple manufacturers can compete. A specification that says “use Brand X model Y, no substitutions” is generally against CSI principles (and UFGS avoids that except in very unique cases with justification). If proprietary specs are needed, follow procedures like obtaining approvals, and still try to list several brands or state “Brand X or approved equal” with criteria for “equal.”
    Performance specs also protect the owner by shifting responsibility of means and methods and certain design aspects to the contractor in design-build scenarios. They ensure that as long as the performance is met, the requirement is satisfied, which is easier to enforce than checking every little method step.
    Summarily, write specs that concentrate on **what the finished work must accomplish**, not step-by-step instructions for the contractor (which can blur responsibility). This aligns with CSI’s approach and fosters fair competition and innovation.

By internalizing these CSI best practices, specification writers can improve the quality and effectiveness of their documents. UFC and UFGS standards already embody many of these principles – the CSI guidance essentially underlies the structure and style mandated by those criteria. Ultimately, specs written in line with CSI standards are easier to use, reduce disputes, and lead to better project results. As CSI famously notes, **well-prepared construction specifications, coupled with accurate drawings, form the backbone of a clear contract** – they tell the contractor exactly what is expected without dictating unnecessary details, allowing for a project to be bid fairly and constructed successfully. The goal is a cohesive set of documents where **“everything required is specified, and everything specified is required”**, achieved through adherence to the industry’s best practices.
