# Consolidated Specification Standards for UFC and UFGS Writers

## Chapter 1: UFC Criteria Document Requirements

1. **Document Structure and Front Matter:** All Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) documents must follow a standard structure. Include required front matter in each UFC, consisting of a cover, title page, foreword, and a Table of Contents (TOC). The TOC must list all chapters and appendices down to the second-level paragraphs, but should not list the front matter. If the UFC is part of a multi-volume series, each volume gets its own TOC, listing only that volume’s contents. Use the official UFC Template to format and generate the TOC automatically. Do not manually edit the TOC; instead update headings in the document and regenerate the TOC.

2. **Page Layout and Formatting:** Use standard page dimensions and margins for all UFC documents. Pages are 8.5 by 11 inches (215 by 280 mm). Set margins to 1 inch on top, left, and right, and 0.75 inch on bottom. Place headers and page numbers 0.5 inch from the page edge. All text (including paragraph numbers) is left-aligned with no indentation (except where noted for special elements like headers or titles). Use 12-point Arial font for all text, ensuring it remains legible if printed in black and white.

3. **Headers and Footers:** Each page of a UFC (including the cover and title page) must have a header showing the UFC designation (document number) and publication date, right-justified at the top margin. The document number (short title) appears on one line, with the date on the line below it. If the UFC is one of multiple volumes, include the volume number in the header (e.g. “UFC 1-300-01, Volume 2”). If the document is a change or revision, include the change number and date below the publication date. All pages from the TOC onward must have a footer with a centered page number. Do not include chapter or appendix identifiers in page numbers. Use lowercase Roman numerals for front matter page numbers (starting with the TOC) and Arabic numerals for the main text (starting with Chapter 1). Omit page numbers on the cover, title page, and foreword.

4. **Paragraph Numbering in UFCs:** Number all paragraphs and subparagraphs in UFC main text and appendices using the automatic format from the UFC Template. Do not modify the numbering style. In UFCs divided into chapters, prefix each paragraph number with the chapter number (e.g. paragraph 2-1, 2-1.1 for Chapter 2). In appendices, prefix paragraph numbers with the appendix letter (e.g. A-1, A-1.1). Use a period to separate hierarchical paragraph levels. Limit nested subparagraph levels to four (e.g. 2-1.1.1.1). Avoid single subparagraphs: if a paragraph is broken into sub-levels, there should be at least two subparagraphs at that level.

5. **Paragraph Titles in UFCs:** Every numbered paragraph and subparagraph in a UFC must have a title (heading text) that succinctly indicates its content. Level 1 paragraph titles (those at the chapter level, e.g. 1-1, 1-2) are bold and written in ALL-CAPS. Subparagraph titles (levels 2 and below) are bold with Initial Capital Letters (Title Case). End all paragraph titles with a period, and place the body text on a new line left-aligned below the title. Indent paragraph titles 1 inch (25 mm) from the left margin (the paragraph number itself remains at the margin). *Example:* “**2-3.7 Capitalization.** Capitalize ‘Contractor,’ ‘Contracting Officer,’ ‘Government,’ and ‘Contract’ in specifications...”.

6. **Spacing and Breaking Text:** Use no more than two short paragraphs under any single paragraph title or subparagraph to maintain conciseness. All text is flush left (no indent) for each paragraph. Maintain consistent spacing between paragraphs (generally 6 to 12 points of blank space) to improve readability. If necessary to avoid a single line at the top or bottom of a page, minor adjustments to spacing (down to 6 points) are allowed.

7. **Organization of UFC Content:** Organize UFC content into chapters and appendices as prescribed. Chapter 1 of a UFC is an **Introduction** that typically includes sections such as *Background*, *Purpose and Scope*, *Applicability*, and any overarching requirements. Chapters 2 and beyond contain the **technical criteria**, divided by subject as needed. Include an appendix for **Best Practices** if applicable (non-mandatory guidance), a **Glossary** appendix defining terms and acronyms, and a **References** appendix listing all cited sources. A simplified outline of a UFC document is:
   - **Front Matter:** Cover, Title Page, Foreword, and TOC.
   - **Chapter 1 – Introduction:** Purpose, Scope, Applicability, etc., as needed (e.g. background context, reference to other UFCs).
   - **Chapters 2..n – Technical Content:** Each chapter covers a major subject area or discipline of the criteria. Use additional chapters as required by the complexity of the subject.
   - **Appendix A – Best Practices:** (Optional) Non-mandatory guidance or commentary for users (if applicable).
   - **Appendix B – Glossary:** Definitions of terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the UFC.
   - **Appendix C – References:** Full citations for all documents referenced in the UFC, including publication titles and dates.
   - *(Additional appendices may be included as needed, following the lettering sequence.)*

8. **Purpose and Scope Paragraph (UFC):** In Chapter 1 of a UFC, include a **“Purpose and Scope”** paragraph that clearly defines the purpose of the document and its scope of applicability. This paragraph is mandatory. For example, a UFC may state it provides requirements for a certain design topic and aligns with specific policies or standards.

9. **References and Source Coordination:** Do not reproduce large excerpts of other standards or criteria within a UFC. Instead, reference the source by publication number in the text and list the full title in the References appendix. Avoid duplicating information available elsewhere; include external material only by reference or with a very brief summary. Any content from other documents that is included verbatim should be quoted and properly cited, and should not exceed one page in length. Quote such material with indented formatting and quotation marks, and provide a source citation for it. *Example:* To reference an external standard, write “design must comply with ABC Standard 1234,” and list *ABC Standard 1234 – “Title of Standard”* in the References appendix.

10. **Revisions and Changes:** When updating or changing a UFC, indicate the changes clearly. In updated UFC publications, changes are often annotated with change bars or specific tags, and a Record of Changes is included near the front of the document. The record should list each change number, date, and a brief description of what was changed (e.g., added new paragraphs, updated requirements, etc.). For new UFCs (first editions), omit the “Reissues and Cancels” paragraph in Chapter 1 since there is no previous version to reference. For updated UFCs, include a **“Reissues and Cancels”** paragraph that identifies the older UFC that is being superseded by the new publication (by number, title, and date).

11. **Applicability Statement:** Every UFC must include an **“Applicability”** section in Chapter 1 defining where and to whom the criteria apply. This section should specify the facility types, project types, or situations the UFC covers. If there are any limitations or exceptions (such as geographic limitations, project size thresholds, or only certain agencies), they should be clearly listed. Use UFC 1-200-01 (DoD Building Code) as a baseline example for defining applicability if needed. Include relevant factors such as:
    - Types of facilities or systems (e.g. “This UFC applies to all new construction of XYZ facilities”).
    - Triggers or conditions (e.g. “for projects over 5,000 sqft” or “in seismic zones 3 and 4”).
    - Service-specific applicability if not a unified document (e.g. only Air Force and Army).

12. **Additional Introductory Sections:** Chapter 1 may also include sections for **“General Building Requirements”** and **“Cybersecurity”** if applicable. These sections would summarize any overarching design requirements (such as referencing UFC 1-200-01 for general building standards) or any cybersecurity criteria (if the UFC involves control systems, IT, or mission critical assets that require cyber hardening). Include them as needed based on the content of the UFC. A **“Glossary”** section can appear in Chapter 1 or as an appendix to define terms used in the UFC, though typically extensive definitions are placed in a Glossary appendix.

13. **Style and Language (General):** UFC documents should be written in clear, direct language. Use the active voice and present tense when possible, and avoid ambiguous phrasing. Detailed writing style guidelines applicable to both UFC and UFGS are consolidated in Chapter 3 of this document. In general, UFC text should be concise, technically accurate, and **enforceable**, since it often serves as mandatory criteria. Avoid promotional or narrative language; focus on imperative requirements or advisory statements as appropriate.

*(Chapter 1 covers the overall requirements for preparing UFC documents. Chapter 2, below, will cover the standards for UFGS guide specification documents.)*

## Chapter 2: UFGS Section Organization and Format

1. **MasterFormat Structure (CSI 3-Part Format):** Organize every Unified Facilities Guide Specification (UFGS) section into the three standard parts prescribed by the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI):
   - **PART 1 – GENERAL**: Administrative and introductory information (references, submittals, quality control, etc.).
   - **PART 2 – PRODUCTS**: Materials and products required for the work.
   - **PART 3 – EXECUTION**: Installation, workmanship, and test/inspection requirements.
   
   Maintain a consistent sequence of subject matter within each part as recommended by CSI. Use standard article titles in the order given by MasterFormat SectionFormat (e.g. in Part 1: References, Definitions, Submittals, Quality Assurance, Delivery, Storage and Handling, Site Conditions, etc.). If one of the three primary parts contains no content (completely not used for a particular section), still include the part and insert the text **“Not Used.”** as the content to indicate that the part is intentionally left empty. Do **not** omit the part entirely, as all three parts must appear even if empty.

2. **Section and Paragraph Numbering (UFGS):** Number sections and subordinate paragraphs in a standardized manner. UFGS section numbers must conform to the latest CSI MasterFormat® numbering system. Typically, this means a six-digit section number with a title matching MasterFormat (e.g. 03 30 00 “Cast-in-Place Concrete”). Within each section, number the paragraphs hierarchically starting from 1 (for Part 1) and continuing sequentially through Parts 2 and 3. For example, Part 1 GENERAL will contain paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.; Part 2 PRODUCTS might continue with 2.1, 2.2, etc. Use the SpecsIntact software to automatically generate and maintain paragraph numbers – this ensures each paragraph is uniquely numbered and follows the required format.

3. **Table of Contents in Sections:** Do **not** manually create a mini-TOC inside an individual UFGS section. SpecsIntact can generate a section Table of Contents automatically if needed for printing, but generally a separate TOC for each section is not included in the final project manual. The SpecsIntact “Process and Print/Publish” function can produce a consolidated TOC for the entire project or insert a section TOC when specifically selected, but this is typically only used for review drafts. In summary, rely on the project manual’s overall TOC to list section titles; within the section, do not list the internal headings as a TOC, unless using the software’s feature for special cases.

4. **Attachments (Appendices, Figures, Forms):** Use section attachments sparingly in UFGS sections. If supplementary information such as large tables, charts, or forms is necessary, it is preferable to provide them as separate files or as part of the project manual rather than embedding extensively in the UFGS text. **Appendices:** Only include an appendix within a UFGS section when absolutely necessary for project-specific data. In SpecsIntact, appendices can be created at the end of a section using the `<ATT>` tag to list them in the section’s TOC if one is generated. For complex appendices (e.g. lengthy data tables, calculations), it may be best to publish them as separate PDF files and instruct the user to insert them into the final project manual. **Figures:** Do not embed figures (drawings, diagrams) directly in UFGS sections as they can disrupt formatting. If a project requires figures within the specifications, attach them as separate PDF pages at the end of the spec or include them in the project manual outside the UFGS text. **Forms:** If forms (to be filled out) are needed, they can be included as attachments or provided via a web link for download. Generally, avoid using attachments except when absolutely required to convey necessary information that cannot be elegantly included in the three-part spec text.

5. **Use of SpecsIntact Software:** SpecsIntact **must** be used for preparing and editing UFGS sections. The software enforces the standard XML-based format (.SEC files) and includes a UFGS section template that complies with UFC 1-300-02 requirements. It will ensure consistent page layout, headers/footers, paragraph numbering, and other formatting elements across all UFGS sections. UFGS sections are published and distributed in three formats: the editable XML (.SEC), PDF, and sometimes MS Word (.DOC) for convenience. Always obtain the latest SpecsIntact version and UFGS Master database from the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) website to ensure you are using up-to-date templates and section numbers. Do not attempt to write UFGS in another word processor or format – the official master must be maintained in SpecsIntact for consistency.

6. **Electronic File Naming and Section Data:** Name UFGS section files by their section number and title per SpecsIntact conventions. Each section file contains metadata tags for section number, section title, and the date of the section (including latest change date). Make sure to update the section’s date tag when changes are made so that the publication date of that section is accurate. The section’s first page (in the header area) will show the section number, title, and date – do not remove or hide this information as it is required for identification and version control.

7. **Section Titles and Part Titles:** The section title should exactly match the official title from the UFGS master list (which aligns with MasterFormat terminology). Within the section, each Part (PART 1, PART 2, PART 3) must be labeled with the part number and name (e.g. “**PART 1  GENERAL**”). Part titles are typically centered and all-caps in the SpecsIntact output. Article (paragraph) titles within the parts should also follow the UFGS standard titles if applicable. For example, common Part 1 articles include **REFERENCES**, **SUBMITTALS**, **QUALITY ASSURANCE**, **DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING**, etc., which should be used when relevant. Adhere to the UFGS subject order: do not rearrange standard article sequences arbitrarily.

8. **Notes to the Designer:** Use “Notes to the Designer” within UFGS sections to provide guidance to the spec editor for project-specific editing. These notes are not part of the contract spec; they are instructions or commentary that will be removed before the spec is issued. In SpecsIntact, designer notes are indicated by double slashes `//...//` or a special tag, and they are output in italic text or in a distinct format. Only include notes that help the editor choose options or understand requirements (e.g. “//NOTE: Use this paragraph only for coastal projects.//”). Do not embed requirements in designer notes – anything that affects the contractor must be in the spec text, not in a note. Ensure that notes you include are deleted or hidden in the final contract specification.

9. **Units of Measure (English/Metric):** Follow the UFGS policy on units: either English (inch-pound) units as the primary with metric (SI) in parentheses, or vice versa if the project is metric. Typically, UFGS are written with English units first and metric equivalents in parentheses. Calculate metric conversions to an appropriate precision (do not over-round or under-round) and to the same significant accuracy as the original English value. Refer to IEEE/ASTM SI 10 for standard practices on rounding and presenting measurements. For simplicity, dimensions and measurements in the spec text should be numerals (e.g. 4 inches, 100 mm) rather than words. Spell out unit names if they are not accompanied by a numeric value (e.g. “measured in feet” not “measured in ft.” in running text). *Exception:* Certain well-known symbols may be used (%, °) in spec text per style guidelines—see Chapter 3 on Symbols.

10. **Reference Standards Article:** In Part 1 of each UFGS, include a **REFERENCES** article listing all the cited reference standards (ASTM, ISO, etc.) that are referenced in the section. Use the proper format: list the publication designation and title. Do not list references that are not actually cited in the text. Conversely, ensure every standard cited in the text appears in the References list. The list is usually formatted as an unnumbered list in alphabetical or alphanumeric order by the designation of the standard (e.g. ASTM E119, IEEE 802.3, etc.). The body text should refer to these by their designation only (e.g. “Concrete shall conform to ASTM C94.”), not the full title. The References article should have an introductory statement per UFGS guidelines (e.g. “The publications listed below form a part of this specification to the extent referenced. The publications are referred to within the text by the basic designation only.”).

11. **Citation of Contract Clauses and Regulations:** Do not restate Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Defense FAR Supplement, or other contract clauses in a UFGS section. The contract clauses (such as those covering quality, warranties, or termination) are included in other parts of the contract and need not be duplicated or paraphrased in the specifications. If a specification requirement is directly related to a FAR clause (for example, “brand name or equal” language or warranty period), reference the clause number or requirements rather than copying it. UFGS documents added a requirement that where FAR clauses are relevant, the spec should reference those clauses properly. For example, if including a “brand name or equal” specification, the section should refer to FAR 52.211-6 for the procedural requirements. This prevents conflicts and ensures that the spec aligns with contract provisions. **Rule:** *Never modify or contradict standard contract clauses within a UFGS; do not include language that weakens or changes the rights and obligations set by the contract clauses.*

12. **Submittals Article Requirements:** Every UFGS section must have a **SUBMITTALS** article (usually numbered 1.3 or 1.4 in Part 1) where all required submittals for that section are listed:contentReference[oaicite:147]{index=147}. Submittals are categorized by submittal description (SD) numbers (e.g. SD-01 Data, SD-07 Certificates, etc.) as defined in Section 01 33 00 **Submittal Procedures**:contentReference[oaicite:148]{index=148}. Adhere to these standards:
    - Only include submittal items that are actually needed to verify compliance with that section’s requirements. Do not call for submittals without a purpose, and avoid “information only” submittals that duplicate other documentation.
    - For each submittal item, use the exact name/term in both the SUBMITTALS list and in the body text where the requirement appears:contentReference[oaicite:149]{index=149}. The SpecsIntact software uses tags to ensure each submittal in the list is tied to a corresponding occurrence in the text.
    - Ensure submittal descriptions match their definitions in Section 01 33 00. Do not repeat generic requirements that are already covered by Section 01 33 00 for that submittal type:contentReference[oaicite:150]{index=150}:contentReference[oaicite:151]{index=151}. For instance, if SD-07 “Certificates” have general requirements in 01 33 00, the technical section should not restate those but only add project-specific details.
    - **Unique Naming:** Each submittal item name in the list should be unique within the section. Avoid listing two different submittal requirements with identical titles, as this confuses tracking systems. If two submittals would have the same name, differentiate them (e.g. “Mix Design – Concrete” and “Mix Design – Grout” rather than both called “Mix Design”).
    - Do not include action submittals that require Government approval unless necessary; categorize submittals appropriately as “Government Approved” or “For Contractor Information Only” per agency policy (Army/Navy/Air Force might have slight differences in approach – coordinate as needed, but the UFGS format will typically note if a submittal is for information only).
    - After editing a UFGS for a project, verify that every submittal tag in the text has a corresponding entry in the SUBMITTALS list, and that nothing extraneous remains in the list. The SpecsIntact verification reports can assist with this.

13. **Submittal Tagging:** Within the text of the section, whenever a requirement is associated with a submittal (e.g. “Submit painting schedule in accordance with Section 09 91 00”), use the SpecsIntact tagging system (angle brackets or other markup) to mark the submittal item:contentReference[oaicite:155]{index=155}. This ensures that if the item is deleted from the SUBMITTALS list, the tag in text will flag an error, and vice versa. The tagged submittal in the text must exactly match the item name in the Part 1 list:contentReference[oaicite:156]{index=156}. When describing the submittal in context, ensure the context makes it clear what is being submitted (e.g. “Provide **Product Data** [SD-03] for each type of pump.”).

14. **Standard Paragraphs and Order:** Follow the UFC 1-300-02 guidance on the arrangement of paragraphs within each part of a UFGS. For example:
    - Part 1 (General) often contains: References, Definitions, Submittals, Quality Assurance (including qualifications, certifications, mock-ups, etc.), Delivery/Storage/Handling, Site Conditions, Warranty (if any special warranties apply beyond the default).
    - Part 2 (Products) might include: Materials, Equipment, Fabrication, Mixes, Finishes – whatever is relevant to list the technical properties of items.
    - Part 3 (Execution) might include: Installation/Application, Erection, Tolerances, Field Quality Control (tests and inspections), Adjusting and Cleaning, Closeout activities.
    
    If a standard heading is not used, it can be omitted, but do not change the order of those that are used. Insert additional headings as needed for clarity, but ensure they fit logically into the sequence.

15. **Optional Text (Bracketed Options):** Use brackets **[ ]** to indicate options or variables in the text that the spec editor must choose or fill in:contentReference[oaicite:161]{index=161}. Brackets are used for two main cases: **choices** (two or more alternatives, e.g. “[oak] [pine] cabinetry”) and **blanks** to be filled (e.g. “[_____]<units>” where the designer inserts a value):contentReference[oaicite:163]{index=163}. Organize bracketed choices with the most commonly used option listed first inside the brackets. Always provide a clear note or indication of what the options signify if not obvious. For blanks, use five underscore characters inside the brackets to indicate a space for insertion of text. Leave a space between multiple bracketed options for readability. *Example:* “Provide [galvanized steel] [stainless steel] fasteners,” indicates the editor should choose one of the two options. If the meaning of options is not self-evident, add a **Note to the Designer** explaining how to choose (e.g. “//NOTE: Choose galvanized for indoor installations, stainless for corrosive environments.//”).

16. **Tailoring (Alternate Text Blocks):** Use tailoring tags in SpecsIntact (`<TAI>` ... `</TAI>`) for larger blocks of text that are included or excluded based on project criteria or agency needs:contentReference[oaicite:171]{index=171}:contentReference[oaicite:172]{index=172}. Tailoring is typically used instead of brackets when the optional text spans multiple paragraphs or when there are many interrelated changes for a scenario (such as differences between Army, Navy, and Air Force requirements within one spec):contentReference[oaicite:173]{index=173}:contentReference[oaicite:174]{index=174}. Reconcile agency differences to minimize the need for service-specific tailoring, but when necessary, implement it as follows:contentReference[oaicite:175]{index=175}:contentReference[oaicite:176]{index=176}:
    - Do not use both tailoring and simple brackets for the same conditional situation; choose one method for consistency:contentReference[oaicite:177]{index=177}:contentReference[oaicite:178]{index=178}.
    - Provide a designer note indicating the criteria for using each tailored option (e.g. explaining when to use Option X versus Option Y):contentReference[oaicite:179]{index=179}:contentReference[oaicite:180]{index=180}.
    - Make each tailored block a complete sentence or paragraph so that if one option is removed the remaining text reads correctly:contentReference[oaicite:181]{index=181}:contentReference[oaicite:182]{index=182}. Do not tailor out half a sentence—structure options as standalone statements for clarity.
    - Tailoring can also distinguish between contract types (Design-Build vs Design-Bid-Build). Some UFGS have tailored sections specifically for D-B projects vs DBB:contentReference[oaicite:183]{index=183}:contentReference[oaicite:184]{index=184}. Use these when provided (e.g. a tailored paragraph that only applies in design-build scenarios).
    - When common text applies to all services or both DB and DBB, avoid duplication by writing it once outside of any tailoring tags:contentReference[oaicite:185]{index=185}:contentReference[oaicite:186]{index=186}.
    
    *Example:* Two alternative paragraphs could be provided, one tagged for Air Force and one for Navy, with instructions that SpecsIntact will include the appropriate one based on the project’s selected tailoring options:contentReference[oaicite:187]{index=187}:contentReference[oaicite:188]{index=188}.

17. **Tables and Forms in UFGS:** Tables may be used within a UFGS section to organize data, but they must be kept to portrait orientation and fit within the page margins. Use the same font in tables as in text, and ensure tables are inserted via SpecsIntact’s table tools for consistency. If a table is very large or wide (cannot fit in portrait), consider rotating it to landscape for that page or splitting it into multiple tables; however, large complex tables might be better included as an attachment or as part of an appendix or separate file as mentioned earlier. For forms (e.g. checklists or test forms), include them as separate attachments unless they are simple enough to incorporate as a table. When including a table, it should be referenced in the text (e.g. “see Table 1”) and should appear after the paragraph where it’s first referenced. Number tables sequentially within the section (e.g. “Table 1”, “Table 2” or by part, such as Table 2-1 for Chapter/Part 2). Repeat the table header row on each page if a table breaks across pages. Apply minimal formatting: use bold for column headers and consider a light shading or line for header separation if needed. Avoid excessive nested tables or overly complicated formatting, as it may not render well in all formats.

18. **Figures in UFGS:** As noted, figures should generally not be embedded in the spec text. If absolutely required, the figure should be centered on the page and placed after the paragraph referring to it. If the figure does not fit in the remaining page space, it should start on the next page rather than splitting the figure. Large numbers of figures can disrupt flow; it is preferable to group them at the end of the section or in an appendix (or omit them from the spec and include them as drawings in the drawing set). All figures must be cited in the text (e.g. “(see Figure 2-1)”). Number figures in the same manner as tables (Figure 1, Figure 2, etc., or by chapter if appropriate). Include a figure caption (title) below each figure for identification. If using color figures, ensure they are still legible when printed in grayscale. Do not link to external images; embed them in the final document so they remain part of the spec file (SpecsIntact allows embedding certain images in the section file).

*(Chapter 2 has detailed how to format and organize specification sections using UFGS standards. Next, Chapter 3 will cover writing style and language usage guidelines that apply to both UFC criteria documents and UFGS specifications.)*

## Chapter 3: Writing Style and Language Guidelines

1. **Imperative Mood and Active Voice:** Write specifications in the **imperative mood** whenever feasible, especially for procedural and instructional content. This means phrasing requirements as commands directed to the contractor, e.g. “Install the equipment level and plumb,” instead of “The contractor shall install the equipment...” In imperative constructions, the subject “Contractor” is implied. Use **indicative mood** (declarative sentences) only when necessary for clarity, such as describing conditions or when stating something that the Government will do. For instance, use indicative for statements like “Equipment shall be provided by the Government” or “The finish shall be free of defects” if passive necessity is needed. Generally avoid passive voice; state who must do what. Instead of “The concrete must be tested in accordance with ASTM standards,” say “Perform tests on concrete in accordance with ASTM standards.” The UFC and UFGS conventions specify:
   - Use the word **“shall”** to indicate requirements binding on the contractor (mandatory actions or results). In imperative sentences, “shall” is understood and usually omitted (imperative form itself indicates obligation).
   - Use **“will”** to indicate actions performed by the Government or a third party (e.g. “The Government will review submittals for compliance”).
   - Use **“shall not”** to indicate something the contractor is prohibited from doing, rather than “should not.” 
   - Do **not** use the word **“should”** for mandatory requirements in spec text. “Should” implies a recommendation or discretionary action and thus is not enforceable. If a requirement is mandatory, use “shall.” (In Notes to Designer, “should” may be used since those notes are advisory to the spec writer, not contractual.)
   - Avoid **passive phrasing** like “to be installed” without specifying who installs it. Instead of “Equipment to be installed as shown,” use either imperative (“Install equipment as shown”) or indicative with a clear subject (“Contractor shall install equipment as shown”).

2. **Tense and Consistency:** Use present tense or future tense consistently for requirements. SpecsIntact templates and CSI practice lean toward present/imperative (“Provide anchor bolts...” implies future action by contractor) which is understood contractually as an obligation. Do not switch tenses gratuitously. For example, don’t write “The tank is painted red. The painter shall apply two coats.” Instead: “Paint the tank red with two coats...” for consistency.

3. **Personal Pronouns:** Minimize or eliminate the use of personal pronouns in specifications. Do not address the contractor as “you,” and avoid “he,” “she,” “they” when referring to generic parties. For example, do not write “He shall notify the engineer...”; instead write “Notify the Contracting Officer...”. Prefer repeating the noun (e.g. “the Contractor,” “the Manufacturer”) over using pronouns like “he/they/it,” which can be ambiguous. If pronouns cannot be avoided and a singular generic person is implied, using the singular “they” is acceptable to avoid gender-specific language. *Example:* “The operator shall submit their qualifications...” is preferable over “...his qualifications.” However, generally rephrase to eliminate the pronoun: “Submit operator qualifications for approval.”

4. **Abbreviations and Acronyms:** Define each abbreviation or acronym on first use in the document. Spell out the term in full the first time, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Thereafter, use the abbreviation. Maintain consistency in using abbreviations once established. Use only standard, well-recognized abbreviations or acronyms, especially those commonly used in DoD and industry. If an acronym is not used at least three times in the text, consider avoiding it and just spell out the term. Certain extremely common acronyms (e.g. “USB,” “GPS,” or “HVAC”) or DoD abbreviations (“DoD,” “U.S.”) need not be spelled out as they are universally understood. Avoid abbreviating in a way that could confuse (for example, don’t use non-standard acronyms that readers might not recognize). Also, do not introduce acronyms for relatively short terms that are only mentioned once or twice, as that adds unnecessary complexity. Maintain an **Abbreviations/GLOSSARY** section if the document is long or has many acronyms.

5. **Symbols and Units in Text:** Do not use typographic symbols in running text when a word is clearer. For example, use the word “inch” instead of the double-quote symbol ″, and “feet” instead of ′ in the prose of the specification. *Exceptions:* It is acceptable to use the percent sign (%) and degree symbol (°) with numerals (e.g. 5%, 90°) in the text, and Greek letters (like α, μ) if needed for technical notation. In tables or lists where space is at a premium, symbols for inches, feet, etc., may be used, and symbols are acceptable in dimensions (e.g. 8′-6″ for 8 feet 6 inches). Avoid the slash “/” in place of words – do not write “and/or” or “galvanized/painted” in specs. Instead use clear wording (“and or or as appropriate” or better, rewrite to avoid the need for “and/or”). Spell out units unless accompanied by a number (e.g. “several ohms” but “5 Ω” could be used in a technical context if appropriate). Maintain consistent formatting for units (don’t switch between spelling out “percent” and using “%” arbitrarily; pick one style based on context, with % typically used with numerals). Keep symbols out of paragraph titles or headings entirely; write out the words in titles for clarity.

6. **Capitalization Rules:** Capitalize terms that refer to specific parties or documents in the contract, as well as official names:
   - Capitalize **“Contractor,” “Contracting Officer,” “Government,”** and **“Contract”** when referring to the specific contract or entities in the context of the project. These denote defined roles (the Contractor party to the agreement, the Contracting Officer as the agency’s representative, etc.).
   - Do not capitalize these words if used generically. For example, “contractor” in a general sense (not the one on this job) would be lowercase, but in specs it almost always refers to the actual Contractor for the project and thus is uppercase.
   - Use the term “Contracting Officer” exactly, and do not use informal variants like “Engineer,” “Owner’s Representative,” or obsolete terms like “Officer in Charge” in UFGS context. There may be slightly different titles for different agencies (e.g. Naval Facilities Engineering Command often uses “Contracting Officer” as well). Stick to “Contracting Officer” for the person authorized to make decisions on behalf of the Government.
   - Capitalize specific document names: e.g. **Specifications** (when referring to the collection of spec sections as a whole), **Drawings** (the project drawings), **Project Manual**, **Section** (when followed by a number or referring to a specific section). But do not capitalize these words if using them in a general sense. For example, “the drawings indicate the layout” (referring to the project Drawings) vs. “these details are shown on the shop drawings” (common noun usage, not the contract drawings set).
   - Examples of capitalized terms in specs (when referring to project-specific items) include: **Division** (for a division of the specs), **Section** (a specific spec section), **Article** (a spec article), **Paragraph**, **Subparagraph**, **General Conditions**, **Supplementary Conditions**, **Architect/Engineer**, **Owner**, **Project** (when referring to the particular project), **State** (when referring to a specific state by name or the State in a project address), **Change Order**, etc.. If these are used just as English words without project-specific meaning, keep lowercase.
   - Do not capitalize words like “subcontractor” or “subcontract” – those are general and not referring to a specific entity in the contract. Similarly, “paragraph” or “clause” when mentioned in passing (like “the following clause”) are lowercase unless referencing a titled clause.
   - Directions (north, south, etc.) are lowercase unless part of a proper noun (e.g. “North America” but “north wall”).
   - In summary, **capitalize defined contract entities and formally titled documents/sections**, and use lowercase for generic terms and descriptions.

7. **Technical Terminology and Word Choice:** Use precise and appropriate technical terms; avoid colloquialisms, slang, or terms that could be misunderstood. For example, do not use naval or trade slang like “bulkhead” to mean “wall” or “deck” to mean “floor” in formal specs. Use the correct technical term (“wall,” “floor,” etc.). Avoid region-specific jargon or outdated terms like “DAP” for roofing cement or “pitch” for slope if not widely understood; prefer standard terminology. Eliminate redundant phrases: do not say “completely fill” (fill already implies completely, just say “fill”) or “end result” (just “result”) or “each and every.” Words like “type” or “kind” are often unnecessary (e.g. “all types of equipment” could just be “all equipment”). Avoid filler words such as “such as necessary,” “as required,” or “appropriate” when they do not add meaning. For instance, instead of “Install conduit as necessary for wiring,” specify “Install conduit for all wiring between control panels and motors” – be clear on the requirement rather than using “as necessary” which is vague.

8. **Avoid Indefinite or Open-Ended Phrases:** Do not use “etc.” in specifications. Either provide a full list of examples or use “including the following:” and list them, or simply state the category (e.g. “other similar products”). “Etc.” leaves too much uncertainty about what is included. Similarly, avoid “and/or” – instead, rewrite the sentence to be clear (often “or” alone suffices, or phrase as “X or Y or both”). Phrases like “as applicable,” “as required,” “as necessary” should be avoided because they are not specific – the specification should state the conditions under which something is required, rather than using these catch-all phrases. For example, instead of “Provide supports as required,” specify who requires it or under what condition: “Provide supports at 5 ft intervals or as shown on drawings.” Do not use escape clauses such as “in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations as necessary” – either require it or don’t; if the contractor must follow manufacturer recommendations, just state that directly without “as necessary”.

9. **Grammar – Subject/Verb Agreement:** Always ensure the subject and verb agree in number. Errors can creep in when sentences are long or have intervening clauses. A common mistake is writing something like “One of the valves **are** leaking” – it should be “One of the valves **is** leaking” because the subject “One” is singular. In specifications, many sentences are imperative (with implied “you/Contractor” subject), so subject/verb is usually straightforward. But when using indicative statements, be careful: *Incorrect:* “The package of tiles **are** delivered to site.” -> *Correct:* “The package of tiles **is** delivered to the site.” If you find a sentence complex, consider breaking it up to avoid confusion.

10. **Parallel Structure:** Maintain parallel construction in lists and compound phrases. For example, if listing actions, use the same verb form for each. *Incorrect:* “Contractor shall 1) prepare surface, 2) application of primer, and 3) paint the surface.” This list is not parallel (prepare – noun – paint). *Correct:* “Contractor shall 1) prepare the surface, 2) apply primer, and 3) paint the surface.”. Another example: use the same part of speech – don’t mix nouns and verbs in a series. *Incorrect:* “The system includes heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning.” (First two are gerunds, third is noun “air-conditioning” as a noun phrase). *Correct:* “The system includes heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning.”, where all three are gerund forms, or say “...includes heaters, ventilators, and air conditioners” where all are nouns.

11. **Punctuation for Clarity:** Use commas, semicolons, and other punctuation in accordance with formal rules to avoid ambiguity. In series, include the Oxford comma (comma before the “and” in a list) for clarity in specs (e.g. “pump, motor, and controller” not “pump, motor and controller”). Misplaced or missing commas can change meanings, so proofread lists of conditions or descriptive phrases. Use punctuation to separate distinct requirements if needed, but do not overuse complicated sentence structures. If a punctuation mark’s omission would change the meaning of a sentence, the sentence should be rewritten for clarity. For instance, “Install equipment, when ambient temperature is below 5°C, in accordance with manufacturer instructions.” – The commas here isolate the condition. Without them the meaning could be misconstrued.

12. **Avoiding Ambiguous Modifiers:** Place modifiers next to what they modify. Avoid dangling modifiers (e.g. “After painting, the inspector shall approve the surface” – grammatically implies the inspector did the painting). Instead: “After painting is complete, the inspector shall approve the surface.” Be careful with the word “only” – its placement can alter meaning: “use only for designated purpose” vs “only use for designated purpose” – in the first, it modifies noun, second modifies verb – subtle difference but important.

13. **Inappropriate or Vague Terms:** Certain phrases are explicitly discouraged in specifications:
    - Avoid **“hereinafter,” “hereinbefore,” “herewith,” “wherein”** and similar archaic/legalistic terms. They add no value and can confuse (simply use clear references or omit these entirely).
    - Do not use **“as per”** – instead of “as per manufacturer instructions,” say “in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.”
    - Avoid saying work must be done “**in a workmanlike manner**” – this is subjective and unenforceable. The specifications should define the expected result or standard of quality directly.
    - Do not use phrases like **“to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer”** or **“as directed by the Engineer”** as a catch-all. If a standard is required, specify it objectively. “Construct wall plumb within 0.25% tolerance” is better than “plumb to the satisfaction of the CO”. The contract already implies the CO must be satisfied that specs are met; adding that phrase is redundant and potentially problematic.
    - Avoid open-ended requirements like “**shall be of first class workmanship**” or “**properly installed**” – instead define what constitutes acceptable workmanship or proper installation.
    - Do not use **“etc.”** or **“and so on”** as noted, and avoid **“including but not limited to”** in most cases – if you list examples, it’s understood the list isn’t exhaustive unless explicitly stated otherwise.

14. **Sentence Length and Complexity:** Strive for clear, concise sentences. Long sentences with many clauses increase the chance of misinterpretation. It’s often better to break a complex requirement into a list or multiple sentences. For example, a sentence with multiple conditions can be formatted as subparagraphs or a bulleted list in the spec for clarity. Always read the sentence from the perspective of a contractor asking “what exactly must I do?” – if there’s any doubt, rephrase it.

15. **Eliminating Unnecessary Words:** Omit words that do not alter meaning:
    - **Articles (the, a, an):** Specifications often drop articles for brevity. For example, instead of “Apply an oil-based paint with a brush to the walls,” it can be “Apply oil-based paint with brush to walls.” This still reads clearly and is more concise. However, do not remove articles when it would sound unnatural or create ambiguity.
    - **“All”:** Often unnecessary – “Provide all materials needed” vs “Provide materials needed” – since if it’s needed, the contractor must provide it, “all” adds no extra force.
    - **“Any”:** Can be ambiguous (do you mean “any one of” or “any and all”?). Prefer more specific language (e.g. “any damage” -> “all damage” if you mean all instances, or “any one of the following” if that’s the intent).
    - Avoid saying **“the Contractor shall”** at the start of every requirement sentence – in UFGS, this is usually omitted by using imperative. Repetitive use of “Contractor shall” makes the text verbose. It’s used in some narrative UFC criteria but within specs, imperative form handles it. Even in UFC prose, once context is set, you can often drop the subject for subsequent sentences in a paragraph.
    - **“Shall be”** usage: In imperative style, the phrase “shall be” is usually not needed; just state the condition or requirement. UFGS often uses a colon “: ” to imply “shall be” before lists (this is the streamlining method; see note below).

16. **Streamlining Technique:** UFGS frequently use a streamlining style where the subject is listed followed by a colon and then the requirement. For example:
    - *Standard Sentence:* “The adhesive shall be spread with a notched trowel.”
    - *Streamlined:* “**Adhesive:** Spread with notched trowel.”
    
    Both have the same meaning, but the second is more concise. This style is acceptable and common in specifications for brevity, especially in listing properties or product requirements. When using this format, it is understood that “shall be” is implied by the colon. A note is often included in the spec front matter stating that “imperative mood and streamlined form” are used and that the words “shall be” are implied where a colon is used. Use this technique to list materials or component properties: e.g. “**Portland Cement:** ASTM C150 Type I.”, “**Aggregate:** ASTM C33.”. Ensure that the context makes it clear who is responsible (usually the Contractor) even in this short form. 

17. **Pronoun Reference Clarity:** As mentioned, do not use pronouns like “it,” “this,” “which” without a clear antecedent. For example, “Apply coating when **it** is above 40°F” – *“it”* could ambiguously refer to the coating or the ambient temperature. Instead: “Apply coating only when ambient temperature is above 40°F.”. Another example: avoid “they” or “their” unless context clearly indicates the noun (and “their” is not taken as possibly belonging to someone else). Often the better approach is to repeat the noun: not “Install bolts on equipment before **they** are grouted” (they could mean bolts or equipment) but “Install bolts before grouting the equipment.” If a pronoun is used, ensure it cannot reasonably refer to anything except the intended noun (if there are multiple nouns in the previous clause, be especially careful). 

18. **No “Same” as a Pronoun:** Do not use the word **“same”** in place of a noun (“replace **same** at no cost” is improper). Replace “same” with the actual item. *Poor:* “If materials are rejected, the Contractor shall replace **same** at no additional cost.” *Better:* “If materials are rejected, the Contractor shall replace **the materials** at no additional cost.”.

19. **Punctuation in Lists and Statements:** Use semicolons to separate complex list items if the list is run on in sentence form. E.g. “Ensure surface is clean; prime coat is fully cured; and area is dust-free before painting.” If bullets or numbered lists are used, punctuation at the end of each bullet can be minimal (a period at the end of full sentences, no semicolons needed in bulleted lists). In a narrative sentence structure, if listing conditions, commas can separate short conditions but use semicolons if any condition has internal commas.

20. **Numbers in Text:** Spell out numbers below 10 in general text (one through nine) except when they are attached to a unit of measure or used in a technical context (e.g. “6 in. pipe,” not “six in. pipe”). Use numerals for 10 and above. Always use numerals with units and dimensions (e.g. 5 mm, 3 days, 2 hours, 4 percent) for clarity. If a number starts a sentence, it should be spelled out or the sentence rephrased (prefer not to start sentences with numerals). Do not write a number twice (no “five (5) gallons” – choose either the word or the numeral; in technical specs, the numeral with unit is preferred).

21. **Units and Dimensions Formatting:** For mixed unit dimensions, you may use symbols for feet and inches in tables or drawings, but in text, either spell out or use the format 8′-6″ for readability. Ensure there is a hyphen between feet and inches if using symbols (as in 8′-6″). For metric, use the unit abbreviation (mm, m, kg, etc.) without a period (per SI conventions) unless at end of sentence.

22. **Preferred vs. Avoided Language – Examples:** 
    - *Incorrect:* “One of the elongated central fasteners **are** to be placed around the eye...” 
      *Correct:* “One of the elongated central fasteners **shall be** placed around the eye...” 
      *Preferred (imperative):* “**Place** one elongated central fastener around the eye...”.
    - *Poor:* “Contractor shall lay brick in a workmanlike manner.” 
      *Better:* “Brick shall be laid in common bond.” 
      *Preferred (imperative):* “**Lay** brick in common bond.” (This eliminates the vague phrase and uses proper voice).
    - *Poor:* “Apply paint with brush to the wall.” (missing article can be okay, but here it might sound awkward) 
      *Better:* “Apply paint with a brush to walls.”.
    - *Poor:* “Install equipment as shown on the drawings.” (This is often unnecessary to say because everything should be as shown. If it’s not shown, spec shouldn’t say it. If it is shown, you often don’t need to remind.) 
      *Better:* Just state installation requirements; if needed, reference drawings for clarity like “See drawing X for location.” Avoid blanket “as shown on drawings” statements.
    - *Avoid:* “and/or” – 
      *Instead of* “Use red and/or blue wires,” 
      *write* “Use red or blue wires, or both, as needed.” 
      *Avoid:* “etc.” – 
      *Instead of* “Doors, windows, etc., must be sealed,” 
      *write* “Doors, windows, and other openings must be sealed.”

23. **Specification Clarity Over Grammar:** While proper grammar is important, clarity and enforceability in specifications take precedence. Occasionally, specification text may use fragments or imperative commands that are not full sentences (e.g. in streamlined lists). This is acceptable if the meaning is clear. Ensure each requirement can stand alone and be understood. For instance, a bullet under a materials list might say “Type: Single-component acrylic” – not a full sentence, but clear in context (it implies “Type shall be single-component acrylic”).

*(In Chapter 3, we focused on language usage. Next, Chapter 4 covers special considerations such as proprietary specifications, warranties, and other contract-related content rules.)*

## Chapter 4: Special Content Requirements and Prohibitions

1. **Proprietary (Brand Name) Specifications:** Avoid using brand names or proprietary products in specifications unless absolutely no alternative exists. The general rule is that specs should be performance- or standard-based, not brand-based. **Do not include any requirement that can only be met by a single manufacturer** unless a justification is made and approved. Use of a brand name in a UFGS is **prohibited** unless formal written approval is obtained from the appropriate authority (typically a Level One Contracting Officer). If a brand name must be used (after approval), follow these guidelines:
   - List the specific brand name, model, or catalog number exactly, and then immediately add the phrase: *“notwithstanding any other provision of the contract, no other product will be acceptable.”*. This exact language is required to legally override the standard “or equal” rights in the contract.
   - Also include a bold, capitalized notice at the top of the section stating: *“THIS SPECIFICATION CONTAINS BRAND NAME PRODUCTS.”*. The UFGS format suggests placing this notice in a prominent location (often in asterisks or a text box on the first page) to alert reviewers.
   - Provide a cost analysis or justification for the proprietary item to show it is necessary and cost-effective relative to the total project (this is usually done in design analysis or as part of the approval request, not in the spec text).
   - Ensure there are enough manufacturers for any specified product to avoid a claim of sole-sourcing, unless it truly is sole-source and approved as such. Typically at least two or three acceptable manufacturers are desired (if only one is named, that’s effectively sole-source).
   - **Rationale:** Including brand names has led to contract disputes in the past. If not absolutely required, it’s safer to specify the performance or salient characteristics and allow equivalents (see next item on brand name or equal).

2. **“Brand Name or Equal” Usage:** When allowing products by brand name or equal, carefully follow FAR guidelines. FAR 52.211-6 outlines the need to list **salient characteristics** that an “equal” product must meet. If you choose to use a “brand name or equal” description in a spec:
   - Obtain approval from the Contracting Officer to use brand names as references. Without approval, it’s better to avoid mentioning brand names at all.
   - List a minimum of two (preferably more) brand name products that establish the level of quality/performance needed. After listing, include “or approved equal” in the clause.
   - Directly following the brand names, describe the essential qualities (salient features) that any proposed “equal” must have. These might include dimensions, capacities, material, compatibility requirements, etc., that are critical.
   - Do **not** use “Brand Name or Equal” without listing the salient characteristics – simply naming a product and saying “or equal” is not sufficient. The spec must define what would make an alternative product acceptable.
   - Remember that if multiple brand names are listed, the contractor can choose any of those without further approval (they are pre-approved). If an “equal” is proposed, the burden is on the contractor to prove it meets the spec’s stated criteria, and on the Government to evaluate it fairly.
   - Ensure that any “or equal” clause does not conflict with the contract’s Instructions to Bidders or Substitutions procedures. Many contracts require substitution requests to be submitted during bidding or a certain time before procurement.
   - As a best practice, try to avoid “brand name or equal” by instead specifying performance. Only use it if writing a performance spec is impractical and you need to cite known acceptable products.

3. **Warranty Clauses in Specs:** Do not include special warranty requirements in the technical sections unless absolutely necessary. The construction contract already includes a standard Warranty of Construction clause (typically one year general warranty by the contractor):contentReference[oaicite:341]{index=341}:contentReference[oaicite:342]{index=342}. Adding additional warranty terms can complicate or conflict with that. However, two classes of exceptions exist:
   - **Extended Warranty Periods:** If the industry standard for a particular item includes an extended warranty (longer than one year) and it is cost-effective to require it, the spec may call for that longer warranty. For example, roofing systems often come with 20-year manufacturer warranties. If using an extended warranty, ensure it’s backed by the manufacturer or installer as appropriate and that it doesn’t simply duplicate the one-year general warranty.
   - **Additional Warranty Terms:** In rare cases, the spec might add specific warranty conditions (e.g. certain performance guarantees or requiring the contractor to pay for extended maintenance) but this must be justified and usually approved by a higher authority. Any such extension or addition should be coordinated with legal/contracting officials (often a Level 1 Contracting Officer must approve). 
   - If a UFGS section has recommended warranty language (some UFGS for equipment include manufacturer warranty requirements), you can include it since it’s been vetted. But in general, do not spontaneously insert a requirement like “Provide two-year warranty for all workmanship” – this could conflict with the base contract and might not be enforceable.
   - Always ensure that if a longer warranty is required, the specification clearly states the **duration** and **scope** (what is covered, and what triggers replacement or repair) so it’s enforceable. Vague warranty requirements are problematic.

4. **Contract Clause References vs. Spec Text:** As noted, avoid repeating contract clauses. For example, do not rewrite the “Suspension of Work” clause or “Differing Site Conditions” clause inside the specs. If there’s a procedural requirement (like something related to payments or disputes), it belongs in Division 01 or the contract, not in a technical section. Specs should focus on technical requirements and performance, not legal conditions – leave those to the contract terms. If you find you are writing something that sounds like a contract legal requirement, double-check if a FAR clause already covers it. For instance, “The Contractor is responsible for project safety” is covered by FAR clauses and EM 385-1-1 for USACE; the spec should not reiterate that but rather reference the safety manual in Part 1 if needed.

5. **Specifying New or Experimental Items:** Be cautious when specifying materials or products that are new to the market or not widely proven. Innovation is welcome, but the Government’s interest must be protected. If you include a relatively new technology:
   - Ensure there is sufficient **performance data** or **test data** available from independent sources. Laboratory tests should mimic real-world conditions and be documented by reputable labs.
   - Require evidence of successful **use in similar conditions** if possible, or at least specify the performance criteria it must meet in lieu of a track record. 
   - The spec should detail the necessary standards the new item must satisfy, since you cannot rely on long service history.
   - Coordinate with procurement if a brand-specific new technology is being considered – perhaps treat it as a provisional or optional item until it gains acceptance.
   - If the new material is very specialized, consider including a provision that the contractor submits extra information (data sheets, test reports) during bidding or after award to prove it meets the criteria.
   - Always avoid writing a spec that only one obscure vendor can meet (unless justified as sole-source) – if a new item is sole-source, follow the proprietary item rules (with approval).
   - In summary, manage the **risk**: new materials without a track record pose risk. Include them only with sufficient supporting data and perhaps with a performance bond or guarantee if critical. Clearly state the required properties so the Government can enforce compliance if the product fails to perform as advertised.

6. **Quality Control and Testing:** If your spec requires on-site quality control, testing, mockups, or inspections, define them clearly in Part 3 or Part 1 (Quality Assurance). Indicate who pays for tests and what standards apply. Many UFGS include a QUALITY CONTROL section with required plans or inspections by the contractor. Ensure not to conflict with the contract’s Section 01 45 00 (Quality Control) or 01 40 00 series – coordinate QA/QC requirements properly (i.e., don’t create duplicate submittals; if contract requires a QC plan, don’t require another in the tech section unless needed). 

7. **Safety and Health Requirements:** Do not replicate the EM 385-1-1 (Safety Manual) or OSHA requirements in each section. Instead, reference Section 01 35 26 (Governmental Safety Requirements) or similar. Only include specific safety measures if unique to that spec (e.g. requirement for hot work permit in a welding spec, or confined space protocols in a sewer spec). Even then, ensure it aligns with overarching safety specs.

8. **Environmental and Regulatory Requirements:** If environmental regulations (like EPA standards, state codes) affect the spec, reference them rather than copying. For example, if a paint has a VOC limit by law, either specify a VOC content (performance requirement) or cite the regulation (e.g. “Comply with South Coast AQMD Rule X for VOC content”). Don’t insert the text of the regulation. In general, mention permits or compliance in Division 01; technical sections can require the end result (like emissions control devices meeting certain output standards).

*(The above covers special cases and general “do’s and don’ts” in spec content. The next chapter will list automated validation checks corresponding to these rules.)*

## Chapter 5: Automated Validation Checks

*(This chapter defines a series of automated checks or tests that can be used to validate whether a specification document complies with the standards and requirements stated in the previous chapters. Each test is uniquely numbered and references the relevant section of this document above.)*

**5.1 Section Part Structure Check:** *Verify that each specification section contains Part 1 – GENERAL, Part 2 – PRODUCTS, and Part 3 – EXECUTION, in that order.* If any part is missing, flag an error. If a part is present but empty, check that “Not Used.” is inserted as required (see **Chapter 2, Item 1**).

**5.2 Header/Footer Formatting Check:** *For UFC documents, verify the presence and format of headers and footers.* Ensure the UFC number and date appear at top-right of each page (except where excluded) and page numbers appear centered in the footer starting from the Table of Contents onward. Check that front matter pages use Roman numerals and main text uses Arabic page numbers (see **Chapter 1, Item 3**).

**5.3 Paragraph Numbering Sequence Check:** *Ensure all paragraphs are numbered consecutively and hierarchically.* No jumps or duplicates in numbering should occur. For UFCs: check that chapter-based numbering (e.g. 3-1, 3-2…) is used properly (see **Chapter 1, Item 4**). For UFGS: ensure numbering starts at 1.1 in Part 1 and continues through Parts 2 and 3 without restart unless the format dictates otherwise.

**5.4 Paragraph Title Capitalization Check:** *Verify that paragraph titles follow required capitalization rules.* Level 1 titles should be all caps; sub-level titles in Title Case (see **Chapter 1, Item 5**). Flag any titles that do not end in a period or that are not bold. Also flag any numbered paragraph missing a title.

**5.5 TOC Completeness Check:** *If a Table of Contents is present (for a UFC), verify it lists all chapters and appendices down to level 2 correctly.* Ensure no front matter (cover, etc.) is listed (see **Chapter 1, Item 1**). Cross-check that the page numbers in TOC match actual locations in the document.

**5.6 MasterFormat Section Number Check:** *Validate UFGS section numbers and titles against the MasterFormat index.* Each section number in the project should correspond to a known MasterFormat 2016 (or latest) title (see **Chapter 2, Item 2**). Flag any non-standard numbers or titles that don’t match the UFGS master list.

**5.7 SpecsIntact Compliance Check:** *Scan the specification files (XML/SEC) for SpecsIntact structural tags.* Ensure that required tags like <SEC>, <PRT>, <PARA>, <SUBPARA>, etc., are present and properly nested. Also confirm that no disallowed formatting (manual indents, manual numbering) is used that would indicate SpecsIntact template was not followed (see **Chapter 2, Item 5**).

**5.8 Designer Note Removal Check:** *Ensure all “Notes to the Designer” have been removed or hidden in the final issue version.* This can be done by searching for the typical designer note delimiters (e.g. “//” or the XML note tags) and ensuring none appear in the output document (see **Chapter 2, Item 8**). If any are found, output a reminder to delete these before finalizing.

**5.9 Units Consistency Check:** *Verify consistent units usage.* For dual-unit specs, check that whenever an English unit is given, a parenthetical metric equivalent follows (and vice versa) throughout the section (see **Chapter 2, Item 9**). Also ensure that numeric values are not double-described (no “five (5)” redundancy). Optionally, verify conversion accuracy of a sample of values (flag if a converted value does not match expected conversion within rounding tolerance).

**5.10 Reference Citation Check:** *Cross-check the REFERENCES article against references in text.* Every standard listed should be cited at least once in the body. Every standard cited in the body must appear in the REFERENCES list (see **Chapter 2, Item 10**). Flag any discrepancies: missing reference list entry or unused reference.

**5.11 Banned Phrase Check:** *Search for discouraged phrases and terms such as “and/or”, “etc.”, “hereinafter”, “as per”, “to the satisfaction of” etc.* (see **Chapter 3, Items 7 and 13**). If found, flag occurrences and suggest revision. This check can use a dictionary of forbidden terms.

**5.12 Passive Voice/Gendered Language Check:** *Perform a language analysis for passive voice overuse and gender-specific pronouns.* Flag sentences that use “shall be” with no clear actor, or use “he”, “she”, “his”, “her” (see **Chapter 3, Items 1 and 3**). While some passive is acceptable, highlight any requirements that might be ambiguous due to missing subject. Also flag any use of “his/her” or similar, which should be replaced with neutral language or specific nouns.

**5.13 Capitalization Check:** *Verify that capitalized terms conform to the rules.* Search for lowercase instances of “Contractor”, “Contracting Officer”, etc., that should be uppercase (context-dependent) and uppercase words that should likely be lowercase (like “Subcontractor” if used generically) (see **Chapter 3, Item 6**). Also ensure directions (north, south) aren’t mistakenly capitalized unless part of a name.

**5.14 Imperative Mood Check:** *Check that the majority of procedural requirements use imperative sentences.* For example, count how many times “shall” appears. A high count of “shall” might indicate overuse of indicative “Contractor shall” style instead of imperative. While not strictly erroneous, the UFGS preference is imperative (see **Chapter 3, Item 1**). Flag sections that use “Contractor shall” repeatedly as candidates for editing to imperative form.

**5.15 Submittals Coordination Check:** *Ensure each submittal listed is tagged in the text and vice versa.* This can be done via the SpecsIntact report or by searching for the submittal tag markup. Flag any submittal entry in the Part 1 list that is not found in the text with the SI tag, and any tag in text that doesn’t match an entry (see **Chapter 2, Item 12**:contentReference[oaicite:375]{index=375}:contentReference[oaicite:376]{index=376}).

**5.16 Bracket/Option Check:** *Identify any bracketed options left unresolved.* After project editing, ideally no bracketed options remain – the editor should choose one. If the automated check finds “[“ and “]” still in the final spec, it indicates an editing choice was not made (unless it’s intentionally left for the contractor, like options to select). Typically, unresolved brackets should be flagged for attention (see **Chapter 2, Item 15**).

**5.17 Tailoring Tag Check:** *Similar to above, check for presence of tailoring tags (<TAI>).* In a project-specific spec, tailoring tags should not be visible in the final issued version; they are used at the master guide level. Flag any residual tailoring instructions or tags (see **Chapter 2, Item 16**:contentReference[oaicite:379]{index=379}:contentReference[oaicite:380]{index=380}).

**5.18 Proprietary Names Check:** *Scan for any explicit brand names or manufacturers in the spec.* If found, confirm they are allowed (either multiple brands with “or equal” or authorized sole-source). Flag any single-brand references that lack the required disclaimer or multiple sources (see **Chapter 4, Item 1**).

**5.19 Warranty Clause Check:** *Search for warranty provisions in technical sections.* If terms like “warranty of X years” or “guarantee” appear, ensure they comply with guidelines (extended warranties only when justified) (see **Chapter 4, Item 3**). Flag unapproved warranty language for review.

**5.20 Cross-Reference Check:** *Check that any internal references to other sections, paragraphs, figures, or tables are correct.* If a spec says “see paragraph 3.2”, verify that paragraph exists. If it references another spec section, ensure that section is actually in the project. Also ensure cross-references use numbers (“see Section 09 90 00” rather than “see above” or “see following” which are vague) (see **Chapter 3, Item 13**). Flag any “above”/“below” references or incorrect paragraph numbers.

*(The above automated checks correspond to specific rules in this document to help maintain compliance and catch errors in specifications. Finally, we include CSI recommendations as additional guidance.)*

## CSI Recommendations (from The Project Resource Manual – CSI Manual of Practice)

*(This section gathers best practices from the Construction Specifications Institute’s Manual of Practice, as provided in the reference images, to complement the UFC/UFGS standards.)*

- **Standard Terminology for Contract Entities:** Use consistent terms when referring to entities in the contract documents. CSI recommends using:
  - *Contractor* – for the party executing the work (do not use “Builder” or other terms).
  - *Owner* – for the project owner (the party contracting for the work).
  - *Architect/Engineer (A/E)* – for the design professional (if applicable).
  - *Contracting Officer* – for the government representative administering the contract (in government work).
  These should be capitalized as they are specific roles (as noted in Chapter 3 above).

- **Standard Terminology for Documents:** Similarly, refer to documents properly:
  - *Contract Documents* – the complete set of documents forming the contract.
  - *Project Manual* – the bound book containing the specifications and other documents (specs are part of this).
  - *Drawings* – for the graphical construction documents.
  - *Specifications* – for the written requirements (divided into divisions/sections).
  Use these terms instead of colloquialisms (don’t say “blueprints” for drawings, etc.).

- **Capitalization of Defined Terms:** As CSI notes, terms like *Article, Section, Division, Paragraph* are often capitalized when referencing the documents (Article in Conditions of Contract, Section of specs, etc.). No capitalization is needed when using them in a generic sense. The CSI Manual indicates not to capitalize “subparagraph” or “clause” usually, since those are general terms.

- **Punctuation Guidelines:** Because specifications are legally enforceable, use proper punctuation to avoid misinterpretation. CSI emphasizes:
  - Always use the serial (Oxford) comma in lists to prevent ambiguity.
  - If omitting or misplacing a comma could change meaning, rewrite the sentence.
  - Use commas to separate each item in a series, including before the conjunction (e.g. “A, B, and C,” not “A, B and C”).
  - Use punctuation, like commas or semicolons, to improve clarity where needed, but avoid overcomplicating sentences.

- **Grammar and Clarity:** The CSI Manual provides examples of poor vs correct vs preferred phrasing:
  - *Incorrect:* “One of the bolts are to be installed...” (subject/verb disagreement).
  - *Correct:* “One of the bolts shall be installed...” (grammatically correct, still indicative).
  - *Preferred:* “Install one bolt...” (imperative, concise) – This is the CSI preferred style aligning with “clear, concise, correct, complete.”

- **Parallel Grammar:** Maintain parallel structure in lists and series as noted in Chapter 3. CSI’s example for terminology:
  - *Incorrect:* “Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning.” (Grammatically not parallel).
  - *Correct:* “Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning.” All terms are gerunds (ending in -ing).
  - This example shows the importance of consistency in word forms for listed items.

- **Avoid Redundancies:** CSI highlights not to use phrases like “each and every” or “any and all,” which are legalistic redundancies – use either “each” or “all” as appropriate, but not both. Don’t say “in a satisfactory manner” – instead specify the end result that defines satisfaction.

- **Avoid Open-Ended Requirements:** Phrases such as “and all other work as necessary to complete the job” are discouraged. The CSI approach: specifications should delineate the scope; open-ended catch-alls are not enforceable. It is understood that the contractor does what is needed to fulfill the contract – including vague statements adds confusion. So, avoid trailing expressions like “… and any other incidentals needed” – specify those incidentals if they can be identified.

- **Trade Language:** Write in the appropriate technical language but avoid informal jobsite jargon. For example, say “masonry units” instead of “blocks” if that clarity is needed, or “reinforcing steel” instead of “rebar” in formal writing (though “rebar” is commonly understood, specifications usually use “reinforcement” or “reinforcing bars”). Use industry-recognized terms that appear in standards.

- **No Subcontractor Directions:** Don’t address subcontractors or trades directly in specs (e.g. don’t say “Painter: do X” or “Plumber shall do Y”). The contract is between contractor and owner; the spec should instruct the contractor, who then delegates to subs. CSI stresses that specs are not the place to define internal means/methods or assignments of the contractor’s team – that’s the contractor’s prerogative.

- **“Or Equal” Handling:** CSI practice when referencing products is to either list several acceptable manufacturers and models or define performance criteria. As discussed in Chapter 4, if using “or equal,” CSI format is to include a clause like “Subject to compliance with specified requirements, products by the following manufacturers are acceptable: [list]” – this implies or equal if it meets requirements. If listing a sole brand (rarely done in CSI practice without approvals), they similarly advise including that no substitutions will be accepted to override the general conditions.

- **Consistency Between Drawings and Specs:** CSI recommends not using phrases like “as shown on Drawings” in the specs to cover missing info. If it’s important enough to mention, it should either be fully in the specs or fully on the drawings. Over-relying on such cross-references can cause omissions (if the drawing doesn’t show it, then the requirement is not enforceable if spec only said “as shown”). Thus, either explicitly specify it or ensure the drawing actually depicts it. The mantra: *Specs and drawings are complementary – what is required by one is binding as if required by both.* So you shouldn’t have to say “as shown on drawings” – it is understood. Only use that phrase for clarity in a specific context, and never to fill a gap.

- **Imperative Mood Advantage:** CSI notes that using imperative mood helps maintain a clear, direct style. For example, “Provide insulation…” is better than “Insulation shall be provided…”, because it’s shorter and impossible to misidentify the subject – it implicitly addresses the contractor. This contributes to what CSI calls the “Four C’s” of specification language: Clear, Concise, Correct, Complete.

- **Do Not Duplicate General Conditions:** CSI’s guidance aligns with not repeating contract clauses. The specifications (Divisions 01–49) should not restate provisions of the General Conditions or other contract sections. If a spec writer finds themselves describing contract administration issues (like how to submit a claim or the project communication protocols), that likely belongs in Division 01 or the contract conditions, not in a technical section. Keep technical sections technical.

- **Grammatical Person:** CSI suggests writing as though instructing the contractor (second person implied via imperative). Do not write from first person (“I” or “we”) or second person explicitly (“you”) in specs. Also avoid addressing the owner or architect in the specs. All spec text should be directed toward the contractor’s requirements, or describing end results.

- **Use of “Shall” vs “Will”:** CSI convention often mirrors the Government style: *“shall”* for contractor obligations, *“will”* for statements of owner/architect actions (e.g. “Engineer will provide xyz…,” “Payments will be made…,” typically only in Division 01). Use *“shall not”* for prohibitions on contractor (“Contractor shall not proceed until…”) rather than “will not”.

These CSI recommendations complement the DoD-specific guidelines. By adhering to both the UFC/UFGS rules and CSI’s best practices, spec writers can produce documents that are not only compliant with government criteria but also clear and effective for project execution.
