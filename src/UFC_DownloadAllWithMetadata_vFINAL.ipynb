The greatest deficiencies in earthwork operations around deep-seated or subsurface structures occur because of improper backfilling procedures and inadequate construction control during this phase of the work. Therefore, primary emphasis in this manual is on backfilling procedures. Design and planning considerations, evaluation and selection of materials, and other phases of earthwork construction are discussed where pertinent to successful backfill operations. Although the information in this manual is primarily applicable to backfilling around large and important deep-seated or buried structures, it is also applicable in varying degrees to backfilling operations around all structures, including conduits.\"\n",

The scores obtained for all buildings or groups in the inventory are recorded in numerical order in an Installation Report to provide a numerical ranking of the seismic vulnerability of the buildings. This ranked list will provide a basis by which military installations can determine the order for performing seismic evaluations. Other building-specific aspects to consider in conjunction with this review should include: general condition, known site-specific seismic geologic hazards, occupancy type, number of occupants, year built, plans for future use, and availability of alternative buildings (redundancy of function).\"\n",

This standard is consistent with the Air Force Corporate Facilities Standards (AFCFS), Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC), and existing design guides. This standard, in conjunction with the AFCFS, defines Air Force expectations for project programming and A-E design decisions. The standard facility prototype design program defines consistent facility requirements across the Air Force enterprise to expedite delivery of a facility. This FC was designed in compliance with AFMAN 32-1084. The objective is to deliver right-sized, flexible, cost-optimized, durable, quality-designed facilities on a life cycle basis to support the Air Force mission.\"\n",
