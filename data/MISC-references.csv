This document provides a unified approach to the appearance, formatting and content
of Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) and Facility Criteria (FC) documents. UFC and FC
are used to provide technical information to plan, design, construct, operate, and
maintain DoD facilities. FCs are criteria documents that are not unified with all Military
Departments.
In accordance with the authority in MIL-STD-3007, UFC are prepared by DoD
committees called Discipline Working Group (DWG), and are published by the Military
Departments under the authority of the Engineering Senior Executive Panel (ESEP).

The style and format is designed to facilitate ease of preparation and use. The DWG is
responsible for the format, technical content, and overall quality of its criteria document
in accordance with the following guidelines:
• Provide documents that meet the format and content requirements in
accordance with UFC 1-300-01.
• Provide technical information in a well-written, straightforward manner.
• Reference non-Government standards to the greatest extent possible and
avoid repeating commercially available criteria.
• Clearly state unique government requirements and exceptions to non-
Government standards and commercially available criteria. Each
exception to the industry standards should be verifiable as to the
functional need and to assure it promotes the lowest life cycle cost.
• Maximize functionality while addressing security, sustainability, energy life
safety, and health requirements. Using lessons learned and innovative
technology, develop the criteria to promote lowest life-cycle cost,
maximum environmental responsiveness, energy efficiency, quality of life,
and productivity.
• Write criteria to the level of the experienced engineer and architect. Focus
on performance criteria. Exclude textbook information, charts and figures,
and other information that is available in non-Government standards,

Write in a direct, active voice with simple, concise sentences in the present tense. Use
language appropriate for the user with the experience level required by the subject
matter. Avoid ambiguous, indefinite terms such as "too short" or "relatively simple."
Quantify whenever possible. Define what applies before using "applicable."
Avoid using the Latin abbreviations for “for example” (e.g.) and “that is” (i.e.) in text.
Write out the lead-in to your example: “for example” or “such as.” The use of Latin
abbreviations is acceptable within tables and figures. For additional guidance, see
Federal Plain Language Guidelines or the Writing Style Guide and Preferred Usage for
DoD Issuances.

  UFC logical start page: 6
  PDF index start page: 15
  Text row start: 11, row end: 22
First 20 lines for section '2-2.1 Mood, Tense, and Voice.':
Use the imperative mood (for example, install equipment). Use “must” instead of “shall”
to prescribe mandatory requirements, actions and procedures. “Shall” imposes an
obligation to act, but may be confused with prediction of future action. “Must” imposes
obligation and indicates a necessity to act.
In documents that are likely to become part of legal contracts, use imperative mood or
“must” to impose a legal obligation. Use "will" to predict future action. Use "can" and
"may" to permit choice and identify guidance. Use "should" to indicate desirable
procedures that are advisory in nature. Don’t use “he” or “she” or “his” or “her”
separately as generic (possessive) pronouns. Use “they” or “their” to avoid gender
specificity. Often, rewriting a sentence eliminates the need for repetitive "he or she"; for
example, "Information managers complete their training" rather than "the information
manager completes his or her training."

Number all main text and appendix text paragraphs. Use the bold paragraph numbering
preset in the UFC Template. Do not change the formatting of the paragraph numbering
in the UFC Template. In main text, number paragraphs and subparagraphs
consecutively from beginning to end, using a period to separate the numbers
representing each breakdown. Where a document is divided into chapters, number
each paragraph consecutively within the chapter, beginning each paragraph number
with the applicable chapter number followed by a dash and then the paragraph number
(for example, 2-1, 2-1.1). Where the document has appendices, number appendix and
paragraphs consecutively within each appendix, beginning each paragraph with the
letter designation of the appendix followed by a dash and then the paragraph number
(for example, A-1, A-1.1). Limit subparagraphs to four numbers separated by periods
(for example (2-1.1.1.1). Generally, if there is a subordinate paragraph there should be
a minimum of two subordinate paragraphs.

one page should be re-organized under appropriate paragraph headings. Lettered or
numbered steps may exceed one page in length, as required. Leave a maximum of 6

Use a table to present information that is best communicated in tabular rather than
paragraph form. All tables must be referenced in the text. Center tables and position
each table after the paragraph which first references it. If this causes the table to break
between two pages, the entire table may be placed on the next page. If tables are not
able to fit on one page, table headers must be repeated at the top of the following
pages. Number tables consecutively within each chapter or appendix, using the chapter
number or appendix letter first, followed by a dash (for example: for Chapter 2, Tables
2-1, 2-2, 2-3), see Table 2-1for an example. Column headings should be bold face type
and consider 25% darker shading for column header background and 1-pt line for
bottom border of column header row and the table outline, see Table 2-1 and 3-1. Font
size may be reduced to a minimum 8-point to enhance the presentation of data within a
table. Tables may be rotated to Landscape format if required.

by example, promoting sustainable Federal buildings through
environmentally-sound, economically-sound, and fiscally-sound design,
construction, and operating decisions. The Federal requirements
collectively are referred to as the “Guiding Principles”, and are detailed in
“Guiding Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings and Associated
Instructions”, February 2016, which replaces “Guiding Principles for
Federal High Performance and Sustainable Buildings”, 2008. Consistent
with UFC program requirements, this UFC integrates DoD requirements
(DoDI 4170.11 and other DoD Policies) with High Performance and
