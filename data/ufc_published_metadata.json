    "summary": "“Soil Mechanics” or DM 7.1 (UFC 3-220-10N) has been a valuable legacy document in geotechnical engineering for 50 years. Revisions to the document occurred in 1982, 1986, and 2005; but for the most part; the document has remained substantially unchanged since the original publication in 1971. DM 7.1 has been on the bookshelf of many civil engineers, it has been used in many graduate and undergraduate soil mechanics classed attended by generations of geotechnical engineering students, and charts and correlations from the document have been cited in numerous textbooks and research papers. Currently, it can be found in electronic format at a variety of sites on the internet. The lasting value of DM 7.1 is attributed to its success in distilling geotechnical engineering design procedures, particularly into graphical examples that are easy to follow and understand. The manual also contains correlations to estimate engineering properties of soil and rock that have become ubiquitous in engineering practice. Although the manual continues to be a part of everyday engineering, changes in the profession necessitate a substantial update of DM 7.1. The manual was initially written when the slide rule was the main calculation tool of engineers. Subsequent revisions predate the widespread use of personal computer software tools that are used by every practicing engineer. The manual also predates the global use of the internet as a means to gather pertinent information and to transfer data and documents. In addition, there have been many new methods of testing, exploration, and analysis that have been developed since the publication of the original manual. This current revision was undertaken with an emphasis on retaining the elements that were responsible for the lasting value of DM 7.1. Graphical examples of engineering solutions, both old and new, are found throughout the chapters. A new chapter has been written that focuses on geotechnical engineering correlations. Details about computer solutions and numerical modeling tools have been added to the manual. Owing to the rapid changes that occur in geotechnical engineering software tools and internet addresses, the authors have tried to minimize the number of URLs and the names of specific software packages in the text. Appendix B contains a listing of software packages available at the time of publication (2021), along with vendor contact information, with the intention that this appendix can be updated periodically in the future."

(See UFC 1-201-01, Non-Permanent DoD Facilities in Support of Military Operations , for construction levels.) The goal is to balance Service members' health and safety, environmental protection, and field-expedient practices. If the HN does not have adequate infrastructure for managing solid waste, it is recommended that a contingency landfill be considered when a camp population is projected to grow to more than 500, when there is potential that the life expectancy of the base camp will be two years or more, and when, depending on combatant command (CCMD) policy, there are site conditions, resources, and logistics available to construct a landfill."

Dust control improves health, safety, and wellness, limits increased costs associated with damage and maintenance on vehicles and other equipment, and minimizes dust signatures during military operations. This UFC discusses dust control methods and materials that have proven effective to reduce dust; provides suggestions for rates and methods of application of materials for various soil types and environmental conditions; and discusses factors, such as availability, curing time, durability, logistics, and economics, which are significant in the ultimate choice of material. Agronomic, topical, and admixture methods are discussed; however, the primary focus is on dust palliatives.

This UFC must be used for the design and analysis of buildings and other structures assigned to Risk Category V. RC V encompasses facilities that are considered to be national strategic military assets (see UFC 3-301-01 Table 2-2). Special design and analysis procedures apply to RC V buildings and other structures. Design RC V structures to ensure that their foundations, superstructures and installed mission-essential nonstructural elements remain elastic, and their installed equipment remains operational when subjected to severe environmental loading. This UFC modifies provisions of the 2021 IBC and ASCE 7-16 for use in analyzing RC V buildings and structures. In cases where a provision in the 2021 IBC or ASCE 7-16 is not modified by this UFC, first apply UFC 3-301-01 and then apply UFC 1-200-01. If neither of these UFC documents modifies the relevant provision, then apply the 2021 IBC and ASCE7-16 directly."

    "summary": "This UFC is written to provide guidance for development of distribution pipelines carrying natural gas, manufactured gas or Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in its vapor phase, that are installed on Department of Defense (DoD) owned property, from the point of delivery by the gas supplier to the points of connection to the buildings’ fuel gas piping. This UFC implements the regulations written in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part 192 (49 CFR 192), Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards. This UFC applies where the DoD is the responsible operator of the distribution pipeline. Where a private utility provider is designated as the responsible operator, this UFC is to inform Government personnel of the requirements that apply to the distribution pipeline. This document does not cover building fuel gas piping, which is the piping system that connects to the last downstream component of the distribution pipeline, either isolation valve, service regulator or meter, and supplies fuel gas to individual appliances. Refer to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 54, the International Code Council (ICC) fuel gas code and Unified Facilities Guide Specifications (UFGS) 23 11 25 Facility Gas Piping for guidance when installing building fuel gas piping. This document does not cover systems used to convey LPG in its liquid phase. Refer to 49 CFR 195 and UFC 3-460-01 for liquid phase LPG pipelines and transfer systems. Refer to NFPA 58, the ICC fuel gas code and UFGS 23 11 25 Facility Gas Piping for guidance when installing a single LPG storage tank with LPG service to a single building."

These boilers are governed by ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section I, Rules for the Construction of Power Boilers and Section IV, Rules for the Construction of Heating Boilers. Typically, these are isolated steam plants under 1.0 bar (15 psig), central steam plants over 1.0 bar (15 psig), and isolated and central hot water heating plans. A heating plant contains one or more boilers. The plant may be an individual boiler serving a single building or a compact group of buildings, or a central plant with several boilers serving many buildings and facilities through an extensive distribution system. The heating plant instrumentation and controls discussed are in general, for a saturated-steam power boiler heating plant. The typical saturated-steam power boiler heating plant discussed will operate at a design steam pressure greater than 1.0 bar (15 psig), with a heating capacity of greater than 422 Megajoule/h (400,000 Btu/h). Instrumentation is a rapidly changing field. The options available in choosing and designing plant instrumentation are numerous. A boiler plant includes a large number of instrument items, all of which have to be specified in the procurement of a boiler plant. This UFC does not attempt to cover all details. Rather, its purpose is to present general guidelines for selecting and designing instrumentation for boiler plants."

The criteria contained herein are intended to ensure durable, efficient, and reliable systems and installations. Guidelines apply to facilityscale applications. A facility-scale project has the interconnection point at the facility's service entrance equipment and generally provides electricity for the facility. A utilityscale project has the interconnection point directly to the utility distribution grid. Facilityscale projects are typically less than 1 megawatt, and utility-scale projects are usually greater than 1 megawatt. For renewable energy systems designed to generate power on a utility-scale, and privately-financed projects, see UFC 3-540-08. Future revisions of this UFC will address additional renewable energy system technologies and components that can be applied on a facility-scale level, such as geothermal energy, wind energy, and on-site energy storage (batteries). Whenever unique conditions and problems are not specifically covered by this UFC, use the applicable referenced industry standards and other documents for design guidance.

This UFC provides safety requirements and guidance for anyone working on or near electrical components rated at 50 volts or above in facilities and related infrastructure. The scope includes electrical substations and switching stations, the associated distribution systems, and extending to electrical distribution systems inside facilities, including electrical equipment covered by UFC 3-501-01. For the purposes of this UFC, low voltage is defined as 1,000 volts or less. Voltages higher than 1,000 volts are referred to as high voltage. Refer to the Glossary for definitions. Note: The prior edition of this UFC designated 600 volts as the upper limit for low voltage because this voltage was considered the highest low voltage that would be typically encountered. The designation of 1,000 volts as low voltage has been chosen to be consistent with NFPA 70E and NFPA 70. However, NFPA 70E provides the same approach distances for voltages between 751 volts to 15 kV, and refers to voltage above 600 volts as medium voltage in its Annex D. NFPA 70 provides different requirements for voltages below 600 volts, between 600 and 1,000 volts, and above 1,000 volts."

It is not intended to cover all aspects of Environmental Engineering. It is primarily intended for building demolition and building renovation projects. It does introduce other topics such as cultural resources preservation, wetlands protection, and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. While topics such as contaminated soil and groundwater are introduced, this UFC is not intended to cover the remediation of all hazardous materials. Where remediation of specific hazardous materials not covered in this criteria is warranted, contact the appropriate Environmental Engineering media manager. Many of these topics are considered during the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. This UFC assumes that appropriate NEPA actions have been accomplished prior to committing resources to any proposed activity. Many facilities were constructed with materials that are now considered hazardous to worker safety and the environment. Removal and disposal of these materials requires a complex analysis of Federal, state, and local regulations to determine the appropriate methods for removing and disposing of these hazardous materials. Use this UFC to determine the minimum environmental engineering design requirements. State and local regulations may be more stringent. Where other state or local criteria regulatory requirements exist, comply with the more stringent requirements."

This manual provides important technical data, information and recommended procedural guidelines for the operation, inspection, maintenance, repair, removal and refurbishment. A mooring is any structure whose purpose is to restrain a ship’s movement and keep it in a relatively fixed location. A mooring is of two general types, fixed moorings and compliant anchor moorings. Fixed moorings are defined as a system that includes both tension and compression members. These systems include facilities like piers and wharves, the components that connect the vessel to the fixed facility (lines, chain, etc.) as well as the fendering used to protect the vessel from damage due to contact with the facility. Compliant anchor moorings are defined as a stationary system that includes primarily tension members with mooring loads transferred into the earth via anchors. Active ship’s anchor systems are excluded. This manual only addresses compliant anchor moorings, but many of the procedures described here are applicable to the inspection and maintenance of fixed mooring systems or their components."

The greatest deficiencies in earthwork operations around deep-seated or subsurface structures occur because of improper backfilling procedures and inadequate construction control during this phase of the work. Therefore, primary emphasis in this manual is on backfilling procedures. Design and planning considerations, evaluation and selection of materials, and other phases of earthwork construction are discussed where pertinent to successful backfill operations. Although the information in this manual is primarily applicable to backfilling around large and important deep-seated or buried structures, it is also applicable in varying degrees to backfilling operations around all structures, including conduits."

Foundations for hydraulic structures are not included; however, foundations design methods for piers, wharves and waterfront structures are covered. Foundation design differs considerably from design of other elements of a structure because of the interaction between the structure and the supporting medium (soil and rock). The soil and rock medium are highly variable as compared to steel and concrete products above the soil; therefore, much attention is given to presenting subsurface investigation methods to better determine the properties of the soil and rock. The seismic aspects of foundation design are presented in detail."

Of particular interest to the design engineer in subtitle C of (RCRA) are design standards for land disposal/land treatment facilities presented in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 264. This section of the law presents two sets of performance standards applicable to this technical manual-one for land disposal/land treatment facilities and the other for ground-water monitoring. The performance standards are directed toward (1) minimization of leachate generation in the waste management facilities and removal of leachate produced before it can enter the subsurface environment (subparts K through N), and (2) backup ground-water monitoring and response programs to remove any detected leachate from the ground water (subpart F)."

The structural systems of each building or groups of structurally similar buildings in the inventory are reviewed to obtain a numerical score. The scores obtained for all buildings or groups in the inventory are recorded in numerical order in an Installation Report to provide a numerical ranking of the seismic vulnerability of the buildings. This ranked list will provide a basis by which military installations can determine the order for performing seismic evaluations. Other building-specific aspects to consider in conjunction with this review should include: general condition, known site-specific seismic geologic hazards, occupancy type, number of occupants, year built, plans for future use, and availability of alternative buildings (redundancy of function)."
